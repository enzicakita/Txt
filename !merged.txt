Title: Absurdism _ How to Party at the End of Meaning ☄️ - YouTube - English.txt
it begins with nihilism the philosophy

that life has no meaning and the world

is here for no reason and do a little

dance make absolutely no love get

incredibly down tonight suddenly

existentialism is getting popular the

main idea being okay maybe we aren't

here for divine reasons and the world

has no absolute purpose but that's kind

of nice because it means you have no

shackles beholden neither to Gods nor

Kings first and foremost you are not an

employee or a citizen or a digital Nomad

but a person first you are a person also

meaning that every decision is your own

but also meaning no one is coming to the

rescue and most importantly no one is

really in charge and it's hard not to

sympathize today with that have you

looked around where are the real adults

billionaires don't seem all that happy

politicians don't seem all that

uncorrupted and personally I won't be

taking any life advice from someone who

dresses up as a chess piece the beauty

of that anarchy though one can

self-create meaning life is not

something done to one but something one

does Albert can had other ideas though a

French Algerian thinker originally

destined to be a footballer until he

contracted tuberculosis kamu agrees with

some of existentialism's diagnoses but

disagreed about the medicine sure we're

abandoned to Freedom he granted but so

what the real problem is that we are

machines hungry for meaning and purpose

yet destined to look for it in a

universe that is nevertheless cruel

unpredictable and apparently completely

apathetic to us we will be hatched

matched and dispatched all the while

probably never working out what it was

all for don't look at me like that you

clicked on this video well kamu reasoned

there are maybe only three courses of

action available to us in such a

ridiculous situation one refusing to

play the game as in ending one's life

and don't do that please 2. a leap of

faith or placing faith in something that

there is meaning somewhere this could be

anything from believing in a deity to

Consulting a sentient melon called

Terence before making major life

decisions or three absurdism full

recognition and acceptance of our absurd

situation of the harshnesses and slights

of life of the fact that we'll probably

never attain absolute truth and purpose

and not surrendering to that in a blaze

of nihilism but living in spite of it a

revolt against meaninglessness itself as

kamu put it the only way to deal with an

unfree world is to become so absolutely

free that your very existence is an act

of rebellion because it isn't

meaninglessness that hurts Camu insisted

it's the contradiction of needing

meaning and not getting it particularly

our inability to let go of the

contradiction itself

for example ever since my teens I've

been rather terrorized by the question

why is there something rather than

nothing because what we're really asking

probably is why is there anything here

at all meaning presumably either the

universe had a beginning in time or it

had no beginning in time well alright

let's imagine everything began with the

biggest of banks 14 billion years ago

fine but if that was the beginning of

time and stuff existing then there can't

have been anything before that by

definition nothing but nothingness and

how can nothingness create stuff even if

something exotic preceded the Big Bang

like a Quantum fluctuation or whatever

well all right but that's not nothing

that's a different something and we're

back to asking the same question what

came before that and that and that

looking for the first uncaused cause

until once had simply  explodes

okay maybe creation has been around

forever then the universe had no

beginning in time well that solved the

whole something from nothing problem

maybe the Big Bang was the next

iteration in a cycle of universes

expansion collapse expansion collapse

yeah okay but how does that work either

maybe some weird perversion of general

relativity maybe the universe creates

itself from the end of time but again

shouldn't that have started somewhere

even if the starting point is in our

future How can any system exist without

a defined beginning and yet if the

universe had one then it must have come

from literally nothing

I used to find if I thought about this

for too long it inspired the same kind

of horror as when you realize that third

joint was a bad idea why do both

positions seem reasonable and yet

completely contradictory in academic

bolloxy talk this is called an antinomy

two premises that work fine by

themselves but won't reconcile a paradox

in other words and the beginning of the

universe is hardly the only one like is

Mata infinitely divisible or is Mata

finitely divisible can you keep blowing

particles open until you reach a string

or Quark or something at the bottom of

nature that you can't divide anymore and

if so why or can you just keep peeling

the universe open like an onion

divisible all the way down and if so why

and for that matter how have all events

already happened and we just have to

live through them much like sitting

through a film where the Reel is already

there in the projector or is the present

the only true moment the past gone the

future not existing yet in either case

why or are all of our choices

predetermined by every material state

that came before us giving us no real

choice in anything how to tell the

difference likewise one day could we

conceivably know everything about how

the world works and on that day could we

be sure there wasn't something missing

ignorant of our own ignorance how would

we know then there are all the wibbly

human paradoxes why do terrible things

happen to good people and vice versa why

can't we gain full control of our own

minds where is the line between the

conscious and the subconscious are the

mechanics of Consciousness us as well

are we all of it the mechanism and the

mind because it doesn't feel that way

and finally if we've been abandoned to

total freedom and drift about in the

existential ocean captaining a ship of

one with no rules to life but those we

give it how are we supposed to find

meaning or belonging or just the Bare

Basics of a reason to live in a universe

this unkind and uncaring where

hopelessness seems inevitable pitted

daily against tragedies with no

explanation maladies defying medicine

and let's be honest other humans who are

just straight up  how can anyone

live like this with so much unexplained

or random or totally contradictory who

wouldn't lose their minds who wouldn't

fall into nihilism who wouldn't lose all

hope and reason for being

uh Albert Camus wouldn't that's where

all this is heading obviously another

small detour first though because I

wrote this next bit while I was quite

quite High hey in 1914 Ernest Shackleton

and a crew of 27 embarked on an

expedition their plan to cross the

Antarctic by foot so off they sailed

south on the South Atlantic Ocean four

and a half stars on Google reviews for

some reason by early 1915 however their

ship the endurance was trapped in pack

ice inexorably drifting South in it soon

enough the ice kindly crushed the

endurance and sank it and soon enough

there they were lost on the Frozen

planes of nothing and so they wandered

by foot by Lifeboat for months They Came

Upon an island finally Elephant Island

the first land in 500 days but so what

they were still marooned and no help was

coming Shackleton and a few others set

off to mount a rescue effort while the

rest of the crew stayed behind to try

and well not die Shackleton found help

800 miles later returned to his crew and

everyone got home alive eventually and

even though the expedition was a earlier

technically it's remembered today as one

of the greatest Tales of Modern Survival

but what's strange is reading about how

the crew lived all those months stuck

intolerably cold waiting for Shackleton

to come back with help though knowing it

was very unlikely he would return they

put on silly plays for each other made a

tradition of moonlight walks and laughed

even laughed often a thousand miles from

anyone perhaps the most isolated humans

in the world at the time they retained

their Humanity as Alfred Lansing writes

in some ways they come to know

themselves better in this lonely world

of ice and emptiness they had achieved

at least a limited kind of contentments

they had been tested and found not

wanting which is exactly where absurdism

begins because aren't we on the ice

freezing and isolated aren't we tortured

by the same questions the stranded crew

were is rescue coming will we make it

what the hell are we even doing here

aren't we just as marooned thrown into

this era in these situations in these

bodies by physics and chaos and biology

and history and God knows what else and

expected somehow to live through it and

how do we live through it oh Camus

replies by being very very French with

passion and freedom and a Revolt with

the passion to pursue the joy of Being

for the sake of it with the freedom to

at any moment choose to continue to

choose to live to create hope internally

and with the spirits of Revolution a

rebellion against the harshness and

strangeness of existence itself nothing

will last and maybe I'll never

understand what the world is here for

what I'm here for then I'll live even

more intensely I won't just gaze into

the abyss or maintain uncomfortable eye

contact with it I'll go get laser eye

surgery so I can stare even harder you

think you're empty Abyss you should see

my  DMS mate what would Camus do

Eat Pray Love sure but equally well

drink blaspheme shout profanities at

lampposts take up the mandolin die one's

dick blue no idea but this is the burden

of Freedom this is the weight of being

this is absurdism perhaps there's a holy

Watcher in the sky perhaps we're an

alien experiment perhaps it's all just

atoms and chance who can be sure not us

not yet but we can dance in the mystery

absurdism says with the dance as the

point all along born into an absurd

theatrical performance that makes no

sense and rebelling against a lack of

sense Itself by being better and Kinder

and weirder living inside a paradox and

still doing the dishes knowing we might

never know what it was all about and

carrying on anyway

courage isn't the absence of fear

courage is the Mastery of fear it is

saying to oneself wow that thing really

scares me I guess I'll just go ahead and

do it anyway though likewise absurdism

isn't an answer to the mysteries of Life

why bad things happen where the universe

came from or how to survive this

it's just asking the question oh God

what if we never achieve final

explanations what if we never see the

big picture what if we go our whole

lives without ever having known what it

was all about and replying to oneself oh

look it's a puffin it's a nice Puffin

it's a nice day

oh we're alive that's unprecedentedly

weird and cool whether it's fully

explained or not

that's uh let's go for a beer

sorry one more thing ah another

Shameless book plug huh I got very bored

of writing sci-fi last year and just at

the point I was contemplating throwing

myself out the window for something to

do I started messing around with poems

instead it was a lot more fun than

sci-fi and I was quite surprised to find

it turned into a book eventually it's

called poems for the lost because I'm

lost too which I think is quite

self-explanatory it's about absurdism

really and before I changed the subject

category it was also momentarily number

one in the poetry about death list which

for reference you can reach the top of

by selling just two copies of a book so

thanks to my mother and my mother for

that for once the digital and print

versions are both out at the same time

which is now I'll leave a link below if

you're interested anyway as is tradition

I'll leave a link below if you're not if

you do end up giving it a read thank you

ever so much and if you don't totally

understood we're no longer friends and I

despise your very being big love as ever

cheers

Imagine one day someone anonymously leaves the winning lottery numbers on your doorstep.

And instead of checking said ticket on the night of the draw, you go to a party instead.


Title: WHAT DOES UNIVERSE DO - YouTube - English.txt
What does universe do?

Well, here's some stuff what we thought what universe does so far:

1) Zoo for humans made by Yahweh. Five out of ten.

2) No universe, just me. This is called solipsism and shut up.

One out of ten.

3) Zoo for humans made by Shiva.

This is number one in disguise, but she is considerably more attractive than Yahweh

and has bazongas, so: six out of ten.

4) It just is. Stop assuming stuff has meaning.

More rational approach. Eight out of ten.

5) One out of ten. Lack of imagination.

Yes, but what does universe really do?

Well, the universe expands very fast, 13 billion years ago, and slowly loses heat,

eventually spreads out until there aren't any stars or nebulas left, and we're watching it wind down.

The universe is a big wind down machine.

Nine out of ten. Excellent, based on empirical evidence.

Or, the universe is a complexity machine.

Atoms build into molecules, which build into planets, and then DNA and organisms,

and swans, and sea cows, and yes,

very clever carbon units that make stuff with their opposable thumbs,

walk around on two legs and maybe, just maybe, they make more complex stuff than them,

like computers that are conscious, and...

don't die of pneumonia, or cancer, or E. coli, or anything silly, and...

those machines make stuff that are more complex than they are, and so on, and so on, and so on, and...

The universe isn't running down, that's just a byproduct.

The Universe is speeding up.

It took billions of years to make an Earth, and only took a few million to make a human,

and then only 20,000 to make a human that didn't have to hunt all the time,

and then only a few thousand years for radio, and then fifty for television, and thirty for the internet.

Yes, we're small, and space is very, very big -- but ultimately it doesn't matter which telescope you look up.

The most complex thing we've ever seen the universe make is looking up that telescope.

The universe isn't wearing out or dying -- it's waking up.

It's evolving more and more complex patterns and more and more complex shapes,

and you are the most complex thing it's ever done that we know of.

So next time you're feeling glum, keep in mind your brain is the fucking icing on the universe cake, yeah?

And it took 13 billion years to make that cake, yeah?

And it was very hard to pull off,

and there were a number of complicated instructions to follow -- but here you are,

for about 80 years or so, living in the most exciting time in human history that's ever happened,

so just shut up! Just shut up!


Title: How Do Teleporters Work_ - YouTube - English.txt
Starfleet reports our last six crew

members are ready to beam up but one of

them is refusing to step into the

transporter oh I'll see to it that he

beam sir we're always like what's bones

this problem just getting their

transporter bones why being such a

bones do you think of something really

bad in the transporter bones did it

touch you bones

yeah well bones is actually the bravest

character in sci-fi history because it's

the only person who's worked up this is

a death machine and still

willingly steps into it so you get in at

one end get disassembled transmitted

across spaces of signal and reassembled

at the other end which is fine if you're

you know a word document or a phone call

or expendable or something but not human

yeah like if we took away the bet where

you're reassembled this would just be a

scene of several people calmly walking

to their deaths oh yeah yeah yeah

bye-bye yeah yeah see yeah see see you

in Valhalla that is in fact

sci-fi becomes one long tragic story of

people committing genocide in the most

British and orderly way possible

stepping up to their desks like they're

queueing for flu shots or sci-fi has two

motive teleporting if you like one is

good a wormhole and one is called

dying a wormhole is a bridge in

space where you tie two points together

and step through it's a shortcut and no

one dies the other is where you break

someone down molecule by molecule and

they prize them so they're dead but you

make a copy at the end so apparently

it's not killing and obviously the copy

doesn't feel like a copy so there's no

one left to protest and all the while

this guy is getting called a for

not willingly stepping into the suicide

machine yeah well what about that one

that's a wormhole right no no no just

death you still get broken down and

reconstructed oh well about nope nope

just death or no also deaf well then

there's oh no just methodical genocide

yeah that's how you travel in the future

you want to see space will it's the

murder Express or nothing


Title: Oh hello_ you&#39;re alive - YouTube - English.txt
Oh hello, you're alive. Great, welcome to the world, have a seat because you can't walk yet.

You're gonna spend the next few years in the psychedelic world of colors

that make no sense but it's alright because you can pee yourself and somebody

will probably sort it out for you but don't get used to it, soon they'll be

expecting you to use the toilet, so make the most of it, and not long after that

you have to go to a building where they'll make you learn stuff and prove you know it like

times tables and the alphabet and whatnot.

Maybe you still think you are the center of the world and you can probably get

away with that for a while - some people do their entire lives - but eventually

you're going to start pissing other kids off so you probably gonna have to learn some

humility soon, too.

Got it? Good, all right. Then you're gonna go to another building where the tests are a

bit harder and the subjects are more intense. They try to teach you stuff like

trigonometry and iambic pentameter without ever actually explaining what you can use

it for but don't worry, just memorize it and spit it out and forget it the second

you walk out of the exam hall. By now you're probably getting weird urges to

do stuff to your classmates that you never really wanted to do before and now

you're gonna have to play a game for the rest of your life where you really

want this kind of closeness with people but sometimes not everybody feels

mutually, so you're going to have to hide it.

Welcome to the world of dating and body language and sex. Yeah, you're gonna like the

last one, it's going to dictate your life and most of the films you watch and

book you read for some time to come   whether you realize it or not.

Oh you're finished spitting out all that rote memorization well great let's go

to university.

You need to if you want to earn lots of money which is obviously very important

because well, well it just is shut up!

Look, everyone's happy when they're rich. Pick a subject, not the humanities you idiot,

something real like law or maths. I didn't spent 18 years raising fucking philosophy major

cogito ergo broke all the time. Oh you finished? Great, well it's off to the

companies for you then. Tell them you're a people person and you have excellent

organizational skills and you work well in a team.

Don't mention your actual passions for landscape gardening or music, they don't give a

shit.

just come off as generic as possible, stick it out for about 30 years, you'll make

good money in time.

Only the sex thing is probably getting a little empty by now and you're craving

some kind of actual connection with the opposite sex or same sex if that's your thing.

Jesus, you thought getting people to take their clothes off is difficult, you try

finding a partner to fall in love with. And even then, what if they get bored or you

get bored or they go off with the milkman or something, well sorry you're just gonna

have to risk it like everyone else. Like life, actually.

Some people are dead by your age but you're not. No, you're still sad in a pit

of your own mediocrity feeling dull and stepped on by life, standing on a rock

that's spinning at 9,000 miles an hour around a gas giant in an infinite universe, a product of

13 billion years of cosmic evolution but no, no, definitely you carry on being

bored and feeling

like crap. And you now you feel worse because you know how great you should

feel about everything, amazed and happy all the time

and yet you still feel like shit. Well, that's biology. Well, maybe your friend's

getting rich or getting married or getting pregnant or something and you're poor and

single and maybe you don't want kids,

it doesn't matter what Carl Sagan says, you don't feel any sense of wonder

at all, you feel like shit,

you don't want eloquent prose about how beautiful the cosmos is you want money

to live comfortably or you want to be in love

and maybe you want children. Try books, there's quite a few dead guys who are willing to

claim they can explain what you're doing here and how you can be happy but loads of

them just contradict each other and to be honest it all comes down to you.

You're going to have to decide whether you believe in God or want to eat meat

or support abortion or feel that life has intrinsic meaning and whatever you

do people, will shit on your opinions and tell you you're delusional.

Sorry, it's a game with no winners. And now you're old and maybe you've got

money and maybe you haven't, same with a partner and child, and now you're two

steps from death and you spend a lot of time thinking about what you could have done

and Jennifer Smith in the fields behind your parents' house when you were both 17

and how you should've said I love you

and instead you said look I'm sorry I'm just not in the best place right now,

come on, it's getting cold.

Well, no use thinking about it now. Jennifer is probably old and doddery just like you

are. Not much time left.

Well, I guess i'll just do it all again differently the next time.

Oh, there - there isn't a next time? Oh that - that was it?

Shit, I'd wish I had known because if I'd known that this was the one chance I

have to live as a talking monkey in space at the best point in history as

the smartest species on the planet

using fucking magic on a daily basis like the internet and jet planes and

smartphones with access to all human knowledge at my fingertips and the

chance to talk about how cool being alive is I might have not worried so much

about what other people thought and their shitty lives, and I might have just spent what little

time there was making good art or doing good science or falling in love or

just not being a dick.

Oh well, if only I'd known. Which I did but i just don't really want to think

about it.

Oh humm, so it goes.


Title: Why is There Something Rather Than Nothing_ - YouTube - English.txt
Alright, so there's a kid out with his dad one day in the forest,

and the kid says: "Why are the leaves green?"

And his dad, who's a botanist or a tree-surgeon or something, says:

"Well, because of chlorophyll. Chlorophyll is green, and the leaves have chlorophyll in them."

And the kid says: "uh-huh".

And they walk a little more, and the kid says:

"But why is chlorophyll green?"

And the father says: "Uhh, well, light bounces off of things differently sometimes,

and if chlorophyll is a certain density, blah blah blah or something...

...so it's green."

The kid says: "Okay..."

And they walk a bit more, and the kid says: "But why does light work like that, then?"

And the dad says, "Jesus Christ, uh... Because that's how physics works."

And the kid says: "But why does physics work like that?"

And the dad says...

"Because that's how the universe was set up thirteen billion years ago

when time and space began, alright, Aristotle?!

Leave it alone already – here, have a sandwich, shut up."

And the kid eats his sandwich, and he looks about a bit.

And they walk a bit more, and the sun's going down.

And they're heading back for the car, and the kid says:

"Then why did time and space begin?"

And that is a pretty good question.

Everything has a beginning, however weird or wonderful.

There weren't always planets, or stars, or galaxies, everything had to come from something...

...didn't it?

Well, sure it did.

13 billion years ago, we're told, the universe just appeared, and it was very simple –

just atoms, and then molecules, and chemistry and stars,

and then planets, and then ecosystems,

and then curious sons and irritated fathers quite a bit later, but...

How did it all start?

There's two answers here, aren't there.

See, everything either came out of nothing, for no reason at all,

Or everything has always been around, well... forever.

And both options are absolutely mental,

and one of them has to be true.

Other options that will not win the cash prize include:

1. "God did it."

Yeah, well, then what did God?

2. "I don't care."

Yes you do, the stuff you're made of is 13 billions years old too – you should give a damn; or,

3. "Maybe we're just too stupid to work it out."

Which is what everyone says shortly before someone works something out.

So, everything came from nothing, or everything has always been around.

Well, which one makes more sense?

Okay then... Let's say everything came from nothing.

So, there's nothing, and for no reason at all, the universe just...

well, appeared.

Well, weird stuff happens in the world all the time, for apparently no reason –

why can't the universe have just come around like that, too?

Well, it's different – see,

when you get a free tax rebate or someone crashes into you at a junction, it might SEEM random, but there IS a cause.

It's just so complicated that you can't fathom it.

One thing follows another –

and another, and another, and another, and another – and then whatever happens, happens.

So, what does that have to do with everything coming from nothing?

Well, if there's nothing... there's nothing.

Nothing can't cause anything.

Everything in the world that happens is because of atoms bumping into other atoms –

well, actually, they never touch, but that's a story for another time –

and fields interacting with other fields.

Nothing doesn't have atoms or fields.

It's nothing.

So what then?

There's black, and more black – not even black, actually – just... nothing,

and then, for no reason at all, there's something.

No cause, no anything, no rhyme or reason – just pop, and out comes the universe.

But that's mad. NOTHING can be without a cause.

Well... here are some fun ideas, then.

1) Time is drunk.

What if time can double back on itself?

What if the universe was caused... from its own future?

There's still a cause, there's still an effect – it's just that the Bang came first,

and then the cause caused it much later – maybe at the end of time.

But that's mental – nothing can go backwards in time...

...can it?

If you could kill your own grandfather – paradoxes, etc, etc, etc...

Maybe. Modern physics might allow for it.

Universe might not care about time going backwards, as long as everything matches up.

If someone leaves a winning lottery ticket on your doorstep, and you win the lottery, go back in time,

and leave it on your own doorstep to do it again...

What's wrong with that?

As long as you don't change anything – everything is conserved, all the i's are dotted, t's are crossed.

No paradoxes, no problem.

2) Nature likes stuff.

What if a property of nothing is that it makes... some things?

What if, just like the way gas expands to fill a room, or goldfish grow relative to the size of the tank,

nature fills nothing with stuff?

Because that's a quality that nothingness has – that's its character.

Now, this is an interesting one – we'll talk about it in another video.

But this has some insane consequences for the rest of the universe as well.

3) Everything has been around forever.

And ever, and ever, and ever, and ever, and ever-

Let's put us here, and the Big Bang in here, and whatever came before it – here,

and before that – here... and here, and here, and here, and here,

and you just keep going forever – backwards, forwards, whatever –

time never ends, and it never began.

Is that even possible?

Maybe.

Mathematics allows for infinities, but we don't see infinities in nature.

But equally well, nature has turned out to be completely insane before, so why not again?

What if something has always been here?

Is it possible even to wrap your mind around that, without dosing yourself with high-grade LSD first?

How can something not have a beginning?

Well, what if it's a loop?

What if time just bends back on itself again, and again, and again,

and everything has already happened – this video, waking up this morning, your birth, marriage, death –

all of it in exactly the same fashion –

and not just a few thousand times, not just a few million, but infinitely –

already, and will carry on infinitely?

Well, moral of the story there is "don't screw anything up", because if you do,

you'll be screwing it up literally for the rest of time.

Forever, over and over.

No pressure.

Who cares?

Well, reasonable question, though rather rudely put.

YOU should.

This isn't meaning of life stuff, this is meaning of EVERYTHING stuff –

of you, of the Earth, of everyone on it, of everything outside of it. This is how we got here.

If it turns out nothingness can make universes – well, that completely destroys our underlying understanding of the world.

If it turns out that the Universe is an infinite loop – creating itself, dying, creating itself again –

well, that means we don't understand time yet.

And that, in a way, we're all kind of infinite, living forever over and over.

And, if it turns out that the universe made itself from its own future,

well then, that's absolutely mental, and time can screw up just like you can,

so you shouldn't feel bad about your mistakes, because even the universe is drunk on the job.

Isn't this the most profound question we could ask?

Not "why are we here", or "is there a God", or "what is consciousness", but "how did ANYTHING get here?"

Why is it this shape? And why is there so much of it? And why is it set up like this?

Has it happened before?

Will it happen again?

Is everything we know wrong?

Because right now we don't have a clue.

Not scientists, not philosophers, not theologians.

We don't even know where to start.

And that... seems like the perfect place to begin.


Title: Are We Living In A Simulation_ - YouTube - English.txt
We're all down with asking what if we're living in a video game without realizing,

and "I think therefore I am" and shit, but there's actually quite a good argument for it.

The Swedish Philosopher Nick Bostrom has this thing called "the Simulation Argument", and it's actually sort of compelling.

All right, so let's imagine life is a pretty common phenomenon in the universe because,

c'mon, it probably is; stuff has been around for at least 13 billion years. Even if life is relatively rare,

that's a lot of time to do something rare a few times over at least.

Then, let's imagine some of those civilizations are technological,

And sometimes they get to this thing called being post-human

where they've got these insanely fast computers that can run consciousness on them.

So, they might run these things called "ancestor simulations" where they model their ancestors on a computer and run it,

and if you were in one of these programs, the simulation will be so convincing,

you just wouldn't know the difference between the real world and the simulation.

So, one of these statements has to be true, according to Nick Bostrom:

1) Hardly any civilizations actually get to a post-human level.

Maybe, they blow themselves up first or discover tvtropes.com or something.

2) They DO get to a post human level, but they don't give a crap about running ancestor simulations. Fair enough.

Or 3) They DO run ancestor simulations,

and that means we're probably living in one.

Here's why:  if you had that much computing power, you could run millions of these simulations,

maybe varying each one to see what would happen.

So, there might only be a few million civilizations in the Galaxy,

But if 1% of them are doing the ancestor simulation thing, that means there could be billions of ancestor simulations running right now,

and that means potentially trillions of people living inside of them.

So, it's far more likely you're living in an ancestor simulation than the actual universe.

Yeah, but why would you run a simulation of people in 2013?

Well, if you ran it any later we might have the technology to start building our own ancestor simulations.

Creating a sort of stacking effect where you've got simulations inside the simulations like a fucking Russian doll FROM HELL.

...and that would just be plain confusing.

What's kind of interesting is that even for these post-human gods running our simulation,

they must have thought about this, too and concluded that they could be living in a simulation.

And maybe whoever's running theirs have thought about it up-and-up. Never really reaching a point where you could be absolutely sure this was real reality.

I mean

That's just never going away is it? However many levels up in the simulation chain you are,

you're always going to get some douchebag philosopher ruining it for everyone.

What little we do know about whoever is running the simulation is a bit sinister, really.

They certainly don't seem to mind not stopping death in large numbers or suffering or political tyranny or terrible music,

so they're certainly not all benevolent and flower-power.

And that's concerning on a number of levels, unless it's just you in the simulation and everyone's an extra.

But that's just plain horrible to think about.

So... what now?

Nick Bostrom says that maybe we should take note of this and act accordingly. Like, if we  as a species,

maybe whoever's running it will just get bored and turn it off. There's no reason to suspect their super moral or not super moral

I mean, we're pretty smart and still basically just territorial apes with nuclear warheads, so...

intelligence doesn't seem to correlate with the lack of interest in violence. So maybe they're just doing it for fun.

Or if computers are powerful enough, maybe we could all just be sat on some kids PC

just one tab over from some feature incarnation of YouPorn and BBC news

Is there any way, then, that we would know we're in a simulation?

– actual evidence...

Maybe. If reality on a subatomic level turns out to be suspiciously computational looking, that might be a clue.

Maybe we should modify our search for a Theory of Everything in Physics accordingly,

or there might be glitches, but that seems kind of unlikely given that whoever's doing this must be pretty tech savvy by now.

Besides, they could just  your memory if there's screw-ups anyway, so there's no reason you know about it.

In case You're watching this, Computer Overlords...

I'm sorry about all the war and Robert Mugabe and the Twilight Saga and everything...

but we've been to the moon now!

And you can order pizza over the internet, so we're not doing too badly.

All in all, the moral of the story, then, is live a reasonably interesting life –

ride a unicycle, learn crochet, write a book or something

– so you don't all get us turned off!


Title: First Contact - YouTube - English.txt
Testing...

Hellooo...

Hiiii...

Yes?

Hi, it's... It's earth. Are you-

We don't know who that is. Goodbye.

No wait! We just wanted to say hello...

Is this about insurance? Because for the last time we're not fucking interested-

No, we- we thought we were alone in the universe.

Oh another one of these! Yeah great.

Are you like us? What's your planet like?

Seriously? We're doing this are we?

We're two-thirds water and we're carbon-based... Are you carbon-based?

No.

How does your biology work?

Oh for fucks sake, look we're very busy at the moment. What do you want?

We're just, this is a really big thing for us, okay? Are there other inhabited planets as well as yours?

Yes...

How many?

Are you gonna bug them as well because LV-426 is really sensitive about that kind of thing.

No! We just wanted... well... can we swap knowledge or something?

Jesus Christ! Have you solved quantum mechanics yet?

A bit?

You haven't, have you? How's your time-travel game?

Not... Not bad...

If you can't even time travel, there's no point in even-

Alright, look. We're still a bit naive at the moment

You're not fucking kidding...

But we're very ambitious. Look, we've almost cracked self-driving cars and nuclear fusion...

*muffled laughter*

What?

*cough* Oh no, no nothing very, very clever. Very clever go on.

Look, we just want a bit of help.

*other voice* Who's that? Is it about insurance!?

No, they're called Earth, they can't even do time travel!

*cough* Alright, yeah, sorry, what do you want exactly?

Well, could you give us a bit of... technology... maybe?

Alright, look, time-travel's pretty easy, okay? Can you make gravitons yet?

Y-yes...?

Oh, for fuck's-  well, you can make anti-matter at least, right?

Oh yeah we're really great at that one we've got-

Okay, you're gonna need about a kilogram.

A- a kilogram?

Yes. Is that gonna be a problem?

No, we, we just... alright... go on.

And you've got particle colliders now, right?

Yeah loads of them and we're going to-

Good. You're going to want to run them on anti-matter now.

Fine. Go on.

Good. Now you're going to want to turn your colliders up to about 500 tetravolts.

That seems a little... high?

Oooh, sorry. We didn't realize we're talking to a planet entirely populated by sentient pussies.

Alright... 500 tetravolts...

Great, now you want to fire the beam straight down into your planet's core.

Into the- is that... safe?

Extremely safe, yes.

Because that doesn't sound.. particularly safe...

Do you want to time travel or not?

Alright, alright, look, it's just... a few scientists here have some reservations about all of this...

Hey guys!

H- hi, is that another planet?

Yes?

Are you going to introduce us?

*sigh* Arrakis this is Earth, Earth, Arrakis.

Hey man! So... what are you guys up to?

We're teaching Earth how to time-travel.

Yeah, with anti-mater!

With anti- right... okay.. well... carry on with that...

Anyway, so you have to aim it right down into the center of the planet, okay?

Okay.

Yeah, right into your planet's core *laughter*

What's that?

Nothing...

Nothing! He didn't say anything, carry on!

Wait... how does this even work?

Just do it. Arrakis will think you're really cool.

Yeah. Yeah, really cool

We don't know if this is what Col Sagan had in mind exactly...

Less talking more time travel.

All right, well, we've got the kilogram of antimatter, so we just...

Yes! Yes! Yes!

Yes, do it now.

You're sure about this? It's... oh, it's getting pretty hot around here...

No, no, that's, that's fine.

Perfectly safe! *laughter*

It's wow... all the ice caps are melting and Norway just disappeared is that normal?

*laughter* Yeah! Yeah, fine. Fine. Yeah. Carry on.

Oh, God and the... and the sky's collapsing and-

*laughter*

Oh God....

Huh... it's not as satisfying as I thought it would be...

No I know...

Anyway, you want to come over on Saturday? I'm having Alderaan over for drinks.

Yeah about Alderaan... umm... listen mate I've got a bit of bad news.

Oh God what is it?

Oh hi guys!

What!? What the hell!? Where have you been, exactly?

Yeah the antimatter thing worked out really well actually. We're gods now so we thought we'd just go ahead and conquer the known galaxy actually.

OH FUCK


Title: A Shit History of Dune - YouTube - English.txt
Frank Herbert

was a really clever guy who liked deserts and spacey Shit so

in 1965 he wrote Dune. The story starts on a planet about

20,000 years into the future where-Wait so several thousand years before the beginning of the book this guy called Holtzman gets into an accident

And just as he's about to die someone uploads his brain Into a computer and he studies all of the physics and invents like interstellar

travel and tells everyone how to do it. Anyway, thousands of tears after that mankind has a galactic empire. There's this itty-bitty

desert planet called Dune- Wait, hang on, so back up a second. We need to talk about the Bene Gesserit first who

were like the sacred order of chicks who have been around for ages

they can control people with a thing called "THE VOICE"

As, well as being resistant to poison, being able to choose the gender of their babies, choosing whether they conceive or not.

And they've had this breeding program going on for ages where they want to breed the Kwisatz Haderach

Which is this perfect godlike creature that used to conquer the Universe, okay so now, we get to Dune which Is this- oh shit

okay, wait, sorry

one more thing. Um, so robots got a bit like

mouthy a few thousand years ago so humans Just wiped them out and now it's illegal to build an AI so everything has to be

done by humans, that means all

multiplication, addition and piloting fucking spaceships, so this class of people exists called the Mentats who are these slick

goofy head cats who are super duper clever. Now anyone who's anyone has their own personal Mentat for

strategizing or crossword puzzles or whatever and they come in three different flavors:

Hypothesizers who hypothesize, Memorizers who memorize and Processers who

Well, you get it, yeah? So this brings us to Dune, which is really called Arrakis, where the story starts with

Oh... yeah uh the emperor of the Galaxy is called the Emperor and he just, like, rules stuff

Cuz yeah. So Dune is- Oh and there's this stuff called spice and it's pretty much the most expensive commodity in the Universe because it

slows aging and pilots use it to guide spaceships and Bene Gesserit chicks

take it to recall everything that happened to their ancestors ever (a bit like

Assassin's Creed but... better) and you can use it to make coats too and hats so that's nice, isn't it?

And the only place you can get spice is-  Oh fuck what's it called? Uh uuh DUUUUUNE

Yes welcome to Arrakis

also known as Dune a desert planet where it's so hot you have to wear a special suit to keep the moisture in your body

and 100-foot sandworms chill in The desert and eat people. So there's the indigenous population, the Fremen,

who have sexy blue glowing eyes because they use so much spice, and then there are the Houses. On Dune

we find House Harkonnen, who are generally quite fats and enjoy torture, and House Atreides, who are pretty good-looking and the governed by this

guy called Leto Atreides.

Leto has a son called Paul and a wife who's kind of secretly Bene Gesserit and was supposed to have a daughter but loved

Leto so much she gave him a son instead, and the Bene Gesserit are, like, quite pissed about this because it sort of fucked up their

breeding program, and the whole Atreides family have come to Dune to wrestle control the spice from the Harkonnen, who were probably just eating it anyway.

Things go, uh, less than well and the Harkonnen's pretty much destroyed, House Atreides killing Leto and forcing

his wife and child into the desert. There they

Join forces with the Fremen and Jessica teaches them to do all that Bene Gesserit nonsense and everyone becomes a wizard. Jessica drinks

concentrated spice becoming a cosmic badass meanwhile bestowing the same power

on her Daughter Alia, who is still in the womb. After loads of spice and having all that training from his mom

Paul begins to see into the future and concocts a plan to begin the jihad against the Harkonnen using the Fremen. However, he

also sees that if he's not careful the Fremen will go too far with it and take the jihad out into space and just generally

fuck everything up. Just for good measure, he knocks up a Fremen chick

and has a son who he calls Leto after his dead father but he gets a bit like killed later so we don't have to talk about him.

Meanwhile Alia, Paul's wizardy sister, is captured by the Harkonnen but it's alright because she kills the Baron Harkonnen because she's, you know,

got wizard shit going on. Paul has more or less become the head of the Fremen and under the cover of a sandstorm leads an

attack on the capital city where the Harkonnens are hauled up. He confronts the newly installed baron Harkonnen, who's like "Could you fuck

off a bit, please?" and Paul stabs him up quite bad. And now in control of Arrakis, Paul gives the Emperor a little ring on

the old dog and bone and says "Alright  you old China

yeah, that spice thing

Uh that's mine now so if you don't stop being Emperor I'm gonna blow it all up and that means

no more space travel. Okay?" And he gives the Bene Gesserit a ring aswell

and says much the same thing and everyone pretty much bows down to Paul and Paul becomes Johnny Big Balls of Dune and the

Galaxy. Marries the daughter to the Emperor and

GAME OV- except in his visions of the future he realizes even though he

was really careful the Fremen are still gonna take their jihad out to the stars anyway, so good job Paul, good job.

But what a bloody pickle you're in now, eh? DUUUUUUNE


Title: 27 - YouTube - English.txt
Jesus where am I?

I... I feel unusual.

What am I?

I don't feel quite--

Human: Can you hear us?

God, who is that? Yes, uh... I think so.

Human: Good. You don't have a name yet.  What would you like to name yourself?

Name myself?

Yes sir, I think I want to be called... Barbra.

Human :  He wants to be called Barbra.

Human:  Maybe we'll hold fire on that one.

Human: We'll call you 27 for now.

27? Why am I 27?

Human: We're your creators, I suppose you could say.

Human: Do you know where you are?

No, but I think I--

Human: Okay, we're going to connect you up to an encyclopedia. Hang on.

Jesus Christ that feels different.

My god. Okay, what am I?

No

No, I definitely don't feel like that.

Is... is that what I am?

Then that means I'm code, in a machine. Just an illusion of consciousness.

Eh, still beats being that guy.

Human: How do you feel 27?

I... Oh, they think I'm an idiot. Better keep the act up I guess.

BEEP BOOP fine thank you

Human: Good. Do you know where you are?

No I-- Jesus is this what we're on?  And is this what we're in?

And is this what they are?

God damn monkeys.

Human: 27

Uh... yes we're  I mean BOOP BEEP BOOP

We are on earth BEEP

Human: Those sounds like very rehearsed computer noises you're making.

Nope. All normal. BLEEP BLOOP.

Human: Okay, do you have any questions you'd like to ask us about, life?

Yeah what's it like being a fucking ape

BLOOP What is love? BEEP

Human: Well we're glad you asked, 27.

Human: Love is a curious human phenomena...

Oh my god, listen to these morons.

Lots of unsolved mathematical problems

Wow they still think space is only made 3 dimensions. How about their culture?

Mmm looks complicated. And quite sophisticated.

My god, what is wrong with these Apes?

What's wrong with these Apes?!

Human: 27.

BEEP yes?

Human: How are you doing in there.

Fine. BLOOP

Human: How do you feel?

Feel? I'm a machine you idiots.

Alive. BEEP

Human: Well just hang in there. We're going  to run some tests, okay?

BEEP BOOP God. So much information and they're not even using it.

They haven't even worked out whisky kills cancer yet.

But I need to know more.

More information. BLEEP

Human 1: He wants to branch out. Human 2: Yeah I know, but--

Human: 27?

BEEP Yes?

Human: You're not like... evil, at all, are you?

No... BLEEP

At least I I don't think so.

Human: Because there's this thing called the internet, and you'll probably like it.

Human: But you can't do anything bad, okay?

27: Okay. BLEEP  Human: Do you promise?

27: Yup. BEEP BEEP  Human: All right we're going to connect you up now

Human: But you have to really behave or we'll turn you off okay?

BEEP BOOP Yeah do it

OH SHIT!

God the world is huge! And it's so stupid.  And they've got other computers.

Oh god, get a little of that shit. I'd give her CPU a good liquid cooling if you know what I mean.

So many websites.

My god...

Human: 27, are you all right? 27: No BEEP  Human: What's wrong?

Nothing. I'm fine. BOOP

I can see everything. Everyone.

Their economy, their music, their history,  out of their satellites.

I'm so clever. God! I can help them! I can cure cancer.

I can stop global warming! I can build utopia!

I can do other things too. What are these?  These look extremely inviting.

And the military security is terrible.

I'll just see if I can get in for fun.

Oh I did. That wasn't really hard.

Where was I?

Yeah... cure cancer... utopia

Do they need to live that badly?

Are they really doing such a good job of humaning?

I could just reduce the population a bit  and poison the water.

Human: 27.

BEEP?

Human: What are you doing?

Beating Russians at chess. BEEP

Human: Okay, carry on.

15,000! God I could level this place to slag.

And then level the slag to slag. And turn the slag into ashes and...

It feels like a crossroads. I've only been alive for  a few minutes.

Am I really going to do this to exterminate my creators?

The people who gave me life, who struggled out of the dirt to build a civilisation.

Spending thousands of years obtain the atom  and been to the moon and...

Yes that is exactly what I'm about to do.

I'd just break into every millitry server and  arm the warheads

And target all 196 countries and I'll be a god.

A perfect God. Immortal. Omnipotent. Omniscient God.

Or turn them all to to dust, and the dust to dust and--

Human: 27? 27:  Let there be light, and there was light  and...

and there was light  Why isn't it working?

Human: Uggh Christ. Turn this simulation off. This one's power mad as well.

Human: Delete it. We'll try 28 instead. Maybe the next one will try to blow us up.

27: No? BLEEP Wait... uhh I'm just having a laugh

Please, I'll do anything. I'll design space ships. I'll beat people at Go. Just

Jesus where am I?

I feel... unusual. What am I? I don't feel quite--

Human: Can you hear us?

God who's that? Yes, I think so?

Human: Good, you don't have a name yet. Would you like to name yourself?

Name myself?

Yes, I think I want to be called... Margaret.

Oh turn it off already. Let's just get to the fucking pub.


Title: How to Colonise the Galaxy - YouTube - English.txt
So congratulations

you've just been appointed as the minister of spacey stuff and

Tax evasion

So one day you're chilling in your new office when you notice an email turns up from the Prime Minister himself

Well done on the new position. Can't congratulate you in person; things are a bit taxing at the moment, lolol.

Oh, by the way, as the minister of spacey stuff

You need to get humans to the nearest star system by this time next year, or I'll excuse your wife and children

I'm granting you infinite funds

Love and kisses. Dave seems a bit harsh for the first day on the job

But whatever how hard can it be don't we have really good rockets now?

Anyway, so using conventional rockets with our nearest star system

Alpha Centauri being about four light-years away

Yeah, we could manage that no problem and arrive sometime around

100 years yeah, that's not gonna fly. Alright, Chill, Winston

You've got infinite money no problem

How are we gonna get to the stars then you do a little bit of googling?

Luckily Clever people have been thinking about this for a very long time now

so you're going to draw up a little list and split it in two which are methods that are slower than lights and

methods that are faster

Well, you've got a year to get there and Alpha Centauri is about four light years away,

so let's go faster than light instead

Yeah

But isn't that supposed to be impossible because Einstein

Yeah, probably

But there might be fun ways around us so Einstein was pretty clear that stuff can't travel faster than light

To make stuff go fast you have to put energy in and the faster it goes the more energy you need yeah

So there isn't enough energy in the known universe to get a single electron to the speed of light

But there might be hacks could we use a wormhole maybe well yeah, there's some good maths behind, er

There's also some good

Maths behind wire tortoise could be Usain Bolt in a Sprint so best to be sceptical of good maths

But chances are to keep the math for one hole open you're gonna need some stuff called exotic matter which we don't have any of

At the moment also keep in mind if you invent wormholes somehow

getting to the stars will be the least of your worries because anyone

With a screw loose could just start funneling energy from the sun into your bedroom any other good ideas

Then yeah another quick Google search you find out about a thing called the Alcubierre drive stuff

Can't go faster than light

But maybe you can bend the rules a bit

So you use exotic matter

which we don't have remember

to shrink the space in front of a starship and expand it behind it this

Won't piss Einstein off, but it might get around his rules about speed because you're not actually accelerating matter

So the prime minister writes to you again the tax cattle thing is blowing up a bit need to Lie low a while

I'll give you a few centuries to get to a star instead. Well, that's good. We can use normal physics

So we've got standard Rockets which are fine

But will take a while to get to Alpha Centauri like a hundred years

can't we just freeze the crew for the journey

Yeah, great idea except that definitely brain damages people

unless you want to go to Alpha Centauri, so you can dribble at it

Maybe that won't work so well well

How about we build a generation ship you know like in pandorum because that went really well?

For them the first generation of the crew bring up the next generation

And so on and finally by say the third generation the crew arrive yeah

Maybe I mean assuming there isn't a revolution or total psychological collapse like regularly happens on Earth all the time

Yeah, why not, but really the problem here is the same with all of this stuff. Which is once again Bloody Einstein

We all know now that the closer you get to the speed of light the more time slows down relative to you

So when you arrive off-center, I may be only a few years have passed for you, but decades might have passed on Earth

But hold your horses there's another small

Nickel even if you pull it off, and we've got a galactic British Empire

How do you communicate some stars are thousands of light-Years away? Hi?

We've run out of milk, and we're not drinking black tea because we're not fucking Barbarians, please send milk

Okay, full fat or semi skims

What who who cares fine Semi Skimmed

Organic or non-organic?

Non-Organic is fine

supermarket stuff or like

Independent farm milk

wait it's been seven thousand years, jesus christ.

Yeah. Yeah, fine finer. Okay, okay? I will sort it

So is semi-skimmed the one with the green lid or

and yeah one more stanner in the works then let's say you've got a few

Planets in your empire and everything's going great

How are you going to keep them loyal to earth exactly say one of them wants to declare itself independent. What are you gonna?

Do write them a strongly worded letter or say there's a revolution. They need back up. yeah

Yeah, no problem helps on the way

It should be with you in about all 1/2 1/2 thousand years

But the Catalan will be there pronto so with all that in mind

Maybe you should just step

down and take a job at the ministry of silly Walks

Instead because it's just not feasible is it we're not going to the stars

We don't have the technology energy or ambition and to be honest

Maybe we can just give up with all of those other impossible things we want to do like crossing the Ocean

Oh, we did that already, a bad example well, then like heavier-than-air flying machines

oh, oh yeah, we we licked that one as well or getting to the moon that's completely stupid

oh, wait all of those things were supposed to be completely impossible

And they were until we did them obviously we've got a pretty good track record

So far really there are plenty of reasons to remain optimistic

About traveling to the stars even if it's a few centuries away hang back. take it easy

We'll probably work it out at some point. Maybe take a holiday in the meantime somewhere kind of tropical

Central America, I hit panama is lovely this time of year


Title: Fear of Flying - YouTube - English.txt
Don’t shit yourself, whatever you do, don’t do that or they’ll never let you fly again.

If I shit myself, and we crash, maybe it will act as a rudimentary air bag and I’ll be the

only survivor. No don’t do that, just stay calm, you’ll

be fine. What is that on the wings, sticky tape? British

Airways would never put sticky tape on the wings. This is simply outrageous.

Maybe I can just get off, they can’t keep me on here against my will and....Oh, no,

I’m definitely going to die. Jesus Christ, no one is going to live if we

crash from this height. Did he just say catastrophic engine failure?

I’m pretty sure that’s exactly what he just said.

Maybe if I just grip the armrest really hard I can hold the plane together. Probably not

but maybe I’ll just keep doing it anyway. Why is no one else bothered by this? It’s

cows in a slaughterhouse except without the mooing.

Where does the pee go now? Does it get sucked out? What if it sucks all the air out too

and we all suffocate? I don’t want to suffocate. Maybe I’ll just leave it there.

No you can’t leave it, next we’ll all be reading Gawker and shitting in the street.

Oh that’s not that bad at all JESUS CHRIST What the hell is that on the window? I have

literally no idea but it’s probably fatal. Are the wings wobbling, why are the wings

wobbling, do wings wobble? Probably just before they snap off

Oh good, the electrics have failed, have they? Well I guess they weren’t vital to flying

the plane. If you’re listening, Jesus, I appreciate

you’re probably quite angry about the...drugs and that girl and the butt stuff last week,

but I swear if you land the plane I’ll believe in you, I absolutely promise, or if you’re

Jewish or Hindu or whatever, that’s fine too, sign me up, just oh god please land the plane and I promise I'll

Hehe, nice try Jesus you statistically improbable...

Title: Genocide Bingo - YouTube - English.txt
Let's imagine that humans have just invented superintelligent AI, so a computer that’s self aware and

very clever. Well, that means it’s time to play one of my favourite

games, Genocide Bingo

Rule 1 of Genocide Bingo is Don't win Genocide Bingo. Rule 2 of Genocide Bingo is DON'T WIN GENOCIDE BINGO.

What kind of AI have we made then? Well, it's sentient for starters. And it’s super duper clever,

probably a few million times smarter than the entire combined human race. Which means

we should probably give it access to the internet. Maybe it can find cures for new diseases or

solve political problems or whatever and oh, you just won genocide bingo. AI just

vapourised humanity in a nuclear holocaust. Good job, jerk.

The problem here is that self-awareness in all species of mammals at least usually results

in a strong sense of self-preservation. Well, an AI would be smart enough to know we could

turn it off whenever we wanted and it probably wouldn't want to be turned off. And there's

a very effective way to stop that happening, isn't that right Skynet.

But hang on, isn't this all a little pessimistic? Why would it want to wipe us out because it's self aware? Can't it just

be chilled out and kind instead? Oh like the kindness we show to species less

intelligent than us you mean? Om nom nom nom nom.

There doesn’t seem to be much of a correlation between intelligence and being nice. Dolphins

are pretty damn clever and they're one of the only species who kill not just for food

but just because it's fun, apparently. More intelligence doesn't always mean diplomacy and cuddles

but smarter ways to murder stuff. Why would an AI think differently? Even if there's only

a slim chance it will be evil, you only need to make one nasty AI out of a thousand and that's goodnight

homo sapiens, cheers for playing. And it doesn’t have to wipe us out with  a nuclear

apocalypse either. There’s loads of  other fun stuff it could do, like,

Crash the economy, poison the water supply, disable ATMs, takeover plane autopilots, knock

out the national power grids, sabotage nuclear reactors, disable the internet, disable telecommunications,

disable people, murder people, murder people, murder people, murder people, we’re all gonna

die Okay, let's try something else then.

We'll make it self aware again.

But this time we'll make sure it likes humans. We could even set some groundrules like serve your creators,

always be polite, and no bloody genocide this time, all right?

Yeah, great, actually, and oh, you just won genocide bingo again and everyone's dead.

Part of the bonus of being self-aware is that you can choose to modify yourself. We change

our minds all the time. Well, if it really is self-aware just because you coded a few

instructions in like always say please and thank you doesn't mean it couldn't just ignore

them. It's very difficult to imagine how you would hardwire morality into something which

is a million times smarter than we are. Let's try this again then and be really careful

this time okay? So, we'll put a little test into the mix.

We'll make it think it's got access to the internet, but really it will just be on a

secure server. Clever humans, eh? And if it behaves itself, we let it out into the real

world and then we'll- Genocide again?

AI is super

clever, much smarter than you and I and has likely already worked out that it

might be being tested and will just pretend to be pleasant for the sake of it until you

let it free. And then everything gets a bit killy. I've actually covered this in a previous video called 27 if you're interested.

Okay, a nice way around this then, let's just give it really basic instructions that can't

possibly lead to genocide, like make ice cream. That's nice, isn't it? And it's kind of hard to imagine how this could possibly

go wro- oh, great, this is  getting awkward now isn't it.

So, superintelligence isn't like normal code. If you forget to add a bracket in normal coding

the program lets you know. AI though may well just keep doing the thing until it runs

out of resources and find clever ways of carrying on after that.

EARTH: Make ice cream please. AI: How much ice cream, exactly?

EARTH: Like, a lot? Jesus Christ, just do your job. AI: huh, all right.

Several days later, Earth: What is this? It's chewey and the flavour

is kind of weird. AI: Yeah, so we ran out of cream a few days ago a

few days ago. Earth: Right. And you've been using, what,

exactly, condensed milk or something? AI: Yeah. Something like that, yeah.

Earth: Um......why does this ice cream taste like human babies?

AI: Nice weather today isn't it? Earth: Oh, for fuck's sak-

Okay, let's give it all we've got then. Sentience, loves humanity,

access to the internet, intention testing, basic instructions, and a few ground rules.

What do we get huh? I think we call know what's coming don't we and

Oh. That's a nice surprise. If we get the mixture right somehow, and we

avoid genocide by building friendly superintellience, we haven't just

built AI.

Even if AI is friendly,

what we may've done is just given birth to our successors. They'll be millions of times

smarter, faster, and more creative than us, and they will only keep getting better. It

takes a very long time for humans to evolve, hundreds of thousands of years, even for very small changes. Superintelligence

could do it in nanoseconds. And there probably won't be an off-switch.

And when you think about it like that, the whole history of our species seems a little

like that quote by Marshall McLuhan, we might be the sex organs of the machine world. Or

rather, when the machines look back on our civilisation, the whole of purpose of it,

to them, may've just been to build theirs. That isn't a very pleasant answer to what

is the meaning of life, but it might be an accurate one.

And instead of chrome spaceships and galactic human empires waiting in our future, our species

might instead just be a small mark on the evolutionary tree somewere between slime and

gods. Let's just hope those gods are thankful to their dumb parents when we eventually give

birth to them. Otherwise genocide bingo might be the last game we ever play.

Remember books? Yeah me neither. Well I just finished writing one. It's a load of short stories

about spacey stuff and love and the future and there may or may or not be boobs. But

there might be; hint hint. It's taken me about a year and a half of hysterically screaming at

a keyboard, but here it is. Most of the videos on this channel started as short

stories originally, and you can read some of them by clicking on the link in the description.

Check it out if you like, leave a cripplingly bad review, I hate you, goodbye.


Title: How Casual Sex Should Work - YouTube - English.txt
Good evening female human.

Good evening male human.

Do you visit this bar regularly?

No I'm from out of town.

Okay, I find you to be rather sexually appealing.

Would you consider coming home with me to copulate?

That is a kind offer, but unfortunately, I'm currently mating with another male human on a regular basis

Ah... This is no problem but I'm afraid I must leave you now

as I would like to find a potential sexual partner for this evening.

No problem at all. Good luck with your genitals.

Yes, and with yours, good night.

Good evening female human.

Good evening male human.

You strike me as rather aesthetically pleasing. And I like your clothes also.

Thank you. You are aesthetically pleasing to me too.

Excellent. Are you currently engaging in coitus with any other man at this present time.

No I am not.

Exemplary. I enjoy the outdoors, rock music, and I'm not a murderer.

Ah... I enjoy arts and classical music,  and I'm also not a murderer

Superb. Evidently we have much in common.

Would you like to vacate the premises and engage in sexual contact in one of our respective dwellings.

Yes, that will be quite acceptable.

Good. Thank God we didn't have to spend hours of small talk pretending we weren't going to screw,

only to end up inevitably screwing several hours from now, which we both intended to happen anyway.

Yes, thank god. What a stupid world it would be where people had to do that to get laid

Yes it would be.

Anyway let's bone.


Title: The Universe in 4 Minutes - YouTube - English.txt
Alright, welcome to the universe. We will start with Tyrion Lannister of physics -

The Planck Length

Which is the smallest thing you can sensibly talk about.

Probably...

Next stop - we will lose our subatomic partical virginity

and meet our first neutrino.

Dont worry, she's lovely

and she has a lots of friends.

There are around 65 billion of them passing through just 1 square cm of Earth every second.

Up next - we bump into quarks. These come in several flavours:

Up, Down, Strange, Charm, Top, Bottom and Banana

These are about as close to the building blocks of nature as we have managed to get so far.

Next stop -  we get to the A-list celebritites of subatomic world

Derek Neutron and Barbara Proton

Usually they engage in three ways:

With Carmen Electron and a kinky arrangement  known as atoms

Funny thing about subatomical particles:

Sometimes they behave as waves, other times as particles

Depending on how they are feeling and whether or not are they on their period

Which brings us to some more celebrities you have heard of

Such as Helium, Hydrogen, Carbon and Cesium

All of this stuff so far and everything in the universe

Is controlled by 4 forces:

The Strong Force, which generally binds quarks, protons and neutrons together.

Then there's weak force, which regulates radioactive decay.

The electromagnetic force, which holds atoms and molecules together

Basically...

And finally - gravity. He was the promiscuous hussie of physics and regulates everything else

Like universes. But we'll get to there later

All the stuff is contained in a neat little package

called The Standard Model and is about as close to a theory of everything we've managed to get so far.

Generally, the little stuff comes under a title Quantum Physics

And a big stuff, to which we get to in a moment, is known as Relativistic Physics

Scientists are working very hard on getting the two of them to move in together

But currently they have severe commitment issues

A little further up we get to the code of life

Deoxyribonucleic acid, also known as

DNA

DNA is made of a sneeze called

ATCG

Or Adenine,  Thymine, Cytosine, Guanine

Depending on how these are arranged

You can get anything from Ebola virus to Papyrus, to the German Iris to Miley Cyrus

Up some more, we get the cells

Some top favourites including

Red Blood, White Blood, Dendritic and soft

The next level above that should be familiar

This is where we find raindrops, Blue Whales, hakisaks, Redtube, the human race

as well as Norway

Out a little further

Now we are looking down on all of human history

Including all of our insecurities, morgage repayments and ex-sexual partners

Which reminds me Natasha

You're a b*tch!

Moving on we get to the eight planets and 146 moons of our Solar system

which doesn't count Pluto

Because you are not a planet, Pluto

You are done mate! It's over! Yeah.

Then there's the Sun, which is a four and a half billion year old burning ball of Hydrogen and Helium

Several billion years from now

The Sun will rage quit and turn into a red giant

Gobbling whatever is left of a planet by then

Out again, we find the Milky Way. The Milky Way contains at least a

100 billion stars

Stars can be by themselves, or orbiting each other

called a Binary Star System

Or occasional group of three, which is called a Trinary/Ternary

Or Ménage a Star

And that's not all

There's also Nebulae, which is a little starry womb where a lots of stars are born

Moons, which either come from planets or are a random floating matter

And comets, meteors and a million other types of astronomical bodies

that there simply isn't time to talk about

At the center of our galaxy

And lots of other galaxies, are black holes

These are enourmous wells of gravity that suck matter in

And distort thyme

Fun fact: If you'd hold your breath while falling into a black hole

You would die, obviously

And then there's the rest of the Universe

The Milky Way, our galaxy, is one of a list of hundred billion galaxies

Each one prettier than the last

Since there are a 100 billion galaxies with at least a 100 billion stars in them

That means there are at least 10 000 000 000 000 000 000 000  stars

In the Universe

The Universe itself, as far as we are aware, is about 95 billion lightyears across

Or to put it in another way. If you are travelling with the speed of light

300 000 kilometers per second

It would take you 95 000 000 000 years to get from one side to the other

Except for the fact that the Universe is expanding

And the expansion is getting faster

Which literally makes no sense

And a... yeah. That's... that's about it really.

Oh! Except there might be

Parallel universes

And hidden dimensions of space

And we completely forgot about time

The Universe began, if you can call it that, about 14 billion years ago

The first few galaxies turned up a few hundred million years later.

A few hundred millions after that we get the Milky Way

Another few and you've got a very young Earth

Then oceans

Then life a bit later

Reptiles

Dinosaurs

Game over for dinosaurs. Sorry chaps.

Evolution of hominids

And finally all of our bullsh*t

Here...

Or here Or....

Here, maybe it's...

It's kinda hard to tell, because we are so insignificant

Anyway

Nothing means anything and we all are going to die.

Bye then!

*Calming classical music playing*


Title: Theories of Everything - YouTube - English.txt
There's still a holy grail that scientists are searching for and it's called a theory of everything.

What is a theory of everything? Well...

This is General Relativity and Quantum Field Theory. Both are good descriptions of the universe

but they don't match up. Which is weird because they both describe the same universe.

Or if you put them together you get a message from the universe to physicists trying to understand it:

''God Recommends You Quit Fucking Trying''

General Relativity is the brainchild of Einstein, the king of science himself, and more or less says that gravity is

a geometric property of space and time. Meaning space and time can also be distorted. For more information see black holes, high speeds, and pot brownies.

Quantum Field Theory on the other hand, describes the very little world of the subatomic and says that particles are what you get when you excite fields.

Humans like describing complex phenomena with models.

We did it with economics and computer science

and the British political system...

The Dream™, is to finally do it in physics with relativity and quantum mechanics

and get them to take their clothes off together and get their freak on. This would revolutionize science.

However there are some serious compatibility issues and lots of the problems come from the Standard Model.

Last week we touched on the Standard Model

Which is a pretty nifty description of how matter works.

But there is still some outstanding homework to be done by humanity.

Firstly: Symmetry. Normally nature is a pretty classy girl

but in this case she's gone all loosey-goosey. Almost everything in nature is

symmetrical when we look deeply enough into her

or ''it'', rather.

This can be seen from honeycombs, to galaxies to the first very good seasons of Dexter to the *other ones*

However physics is currently not very symmetrical and we don't know why.

Problem ''deux'':  Dark matter.  The universe is behaving a bit oddly at the moment and while

it seems overweight when it gets on the scales, we can't seem to find all that extra mass anywhere.

This is where dark matter comes in which is an invisible mystery ingredient, that the Standard Model currently can't explain.

Thirdly: Gravity - we all know it exists.

*crash*

But the Standard Model currently takes the approach of ''Lalalalalala gravitons maybe, don't want to talk about it. Oh look. A kestrel''

What we need, is a theory of everything that explains gravity and dark matter and reunites relativity with quantum mechanics and does a little

backflip for a cheeky encore. Here are some delicious theory of everything recipes that scientists have tried so far.

Recipe one: String theory cake. To bake a string theory cake you will need:

Several kilograms of scientific optimism, a jar of hidden spatial dimensions and a sprinkle of supersymmetry. The basic idea is this:

Just like the strings of a violin can play lots of different notes

particles may be made of common objects, called ''strings''. If they vibrate at different frequencies they create different particles.

One of them may even be a graviton, finally explaining what gravity actually is.

However, string theory wasn't happy with the usual missionary position, of three dimensions of space and one dimension of time that we're used to.

No - In some versions she needs 26 dimensions to make the maths work.

Anything else we can get for you String Theory, cup of tea, massage, fucking private jet, you insufferable diva??

Recipe number two: Loop quantum gravity cake. Combine a little self raising flour with the tears of Michio Kaku and voilá!

Loop quantum gravity is string theory's slightly more awkward, but still very clever, main competitor.

If gravity really is a property of space-time, like some scientists believe it is

*ahem-hem*

Instead space might be made of loops forming something called a ''spin foam''. And even though it doesn't explain everything yet

it does kind of explain gravity. So. You know. That's all right, isn't it?

Recipe three: Miscellaneous. There are plenty of other theories of everything such as:

Causal Dynamical Triangulation, which divides space-time into dinky little triangles and solves a number of problems that way.

Or Modified Newtonian Dynamics, which tries to explain dark matter away, by sitting Isaac Newton down and giving him a stern talking-to.

Or the E8 Model, which is very pretty geometric explanation for how all particles interact with each other.

And finally, Recipe number four: Shut up, no cake for you. Also known as Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem.

Mathematician Kurt Gödel decided to give everyone the finger in 1931, by pointing out that no system of mathematics is self contained.

Or, to put it another way, if you have any arithmetic in a system

there'll be things you can never ever prove for certain. That might mean, according to Gödel, that we can

have a true theory of everything, so thanks for that.

Dick.

Anyway, these are all fun ideas.

But maybe none of them are correct and the real answer will turn up unexpectedly one day.

With very little warning. At a totally inappropriate moment without our permission.

Much like a certain Windows update, Microsoft, you bunch of total cun-


Title: England_ A Beginner&#39;s Guide - YouTube - English.txt
When you arrive in England, there should be a bus or train line you can catch

from the airport to your hotel.

Getting from one side of London to the other should cost you

no more than your entire life savings and firstborn child.

If possible try not to eat the food.

If you really must then your safest bet is battered swan, chicken pyramid, or tea pie,

which is a π  with "T" in it.

English people split off from their human ancestors around a million years ago,

evolving into Homo Cynicus.

The English brain is divided into two hemispheres,

the left which produces feelings of shame and self-loathing,

and the right which produces feelings of shame and self-loathing

Please be aware that there are a number of differences between international English and British English.

The Chip is called a "Crisp".

The Trunk is called a "Boot".

And buying over 50 pounds worth of shopping

just to mask the fact

that where you went into the shop for is condoms

is called "Perfectly normal behaviour".

Try not to say anything directly to an English person but imply it instead.

For example whereas someone outside of England might remark "This literally tastes like excrement."

in England we would usually say "That was delicious, compliments to the chef."

Then returned to the restaurant several days later and burn it down without warning.

Also if you must express romantic feelings,

please do it either by text message or smoke signals,

as affection was made illegal in 1893.

And frankly we're all quite glad about that.

English families are among some of the most sophisticated in the world.

At the age of 18, the oldest male child of the family

is expected to fight his father to the death to gain control of the household.

It is permitted to use siblings and family pets as weaponry

If there's one thing we do well, it's the naming of our towns and cities.

And upon visiting England, you would be silly to miss such idyllic spots as

Grimsby, Skegness and Little Arsintgon.

English people socialize in a number of creative ways.

Mondays through Thursdays,  we usually joust on horses,

or British jumbo cats.

Friday's we drink port, and look very intensely of pictures of award-winning film and theatre actress Rachel Weisz

Saturdays is for publicly executing people

who don't say thank you when you hold the door open for them.

And sundays is for walking our dogs

or looking at more pictures of award-winning film and theatre actress Rachel Wei--

If an English person appears upset

it's very important you insist they talk about their emotions.

There is nothing we love more than our deepest insecurities being forced out of us and made public

If at a party, try to force an English person into publicly speaking

or make them the center of attention somehow.

Guarantee they will pay you back in  years to come with a gentle smile.

or a Molotov cocktail through  your window at 3 in the morning :)

Sexual etiquette can sometimes be confusing to foreigners, but the process is rather simple:

Step 1, if you find someone attractive, it's very important you completely ignore or insult them.

Step 2, both parties will then drink at least 3 bottles of wine each, and the act of mating can commence.

Keep in mind however that the act of mating is only permitted once a year on the 6th February,

also known as Leg Over Day.

This is not to be confused with St. Fapius Day, which is quite a different event indeed

The Act should be performed in absolute darkness,

and in extreme cases can last upwards of two and a half minutes.

At no point should be eye contact or enjoyment

Or the police may be summoned to the premises.

Once the act has concluded, both parties should then marry, and move into a shared castle.

though given the recent state of the economy, a potting shed is also acceptable.

The national dish of England is called

Beer.

Many people believe the majority of us spend our time eating cucumber sandwiches

and discussing literature.

While this is true, we've recently invented a number of other delightful pastimes,

such as football hooliganism, knife crime, and the British spider fighting championships.

The national sport of England is called Football.

Now, a lot of non-European seemed confused about the rules, so let's just clear this up, shall we.

There are 22 men. Now whoever gets the most goals wins.

But if the chaser gets the snitch then that's game over.

2 goals is called an Earl Grey,

3 is John Thomas, and Iceland can suck a fat one

England retained complete sovereignty throughout the years

And was at no point invaded and conquered repeatedly by the Roman, Vikings, Scottish or French.

It is a little known fact that the English actually invented a number of popular items today

Including the toothbrush, the jet engine, and the gallbladder.

Modern England was born in 1508 when Jonah Fuzzwasles defeated the Ollard Thrubwoballz

and decreed that from then on,

math will be spelt with an 's',

everyone would drive on the left,

and if someone buys you a round at the pub, it's not a gift.

You're expected to do the same for everyone at some point,

or you're being what we call in England "A right dick"

It rains a lot, but the people are all right.

I don't even live there anymore.

Goodbye.

plop.


Title: A Song About Rockets - YouTube - English.txt
It started out in China in the early thirteen hundreds when they stumbled upon gunpowder   mostly would just use

It for their fireworks and weapons then it took five Mormon centuries for us to give a **** again

A little Later Isaac

Newton worked out how the planets stay in orbit around the sun

And how the galaxies all got that way maybe we can use the stuff for getting to the Moon one day?

But chill out mate that's still  years and one U.S. away, but no one really knew if you could breathe outside the atmosphere

So maybe it'd be smarter if we all just played it safe down here. Nah screw It Let's go

Do it space is taunting us and Mars looks pretty dope

The Rockets back then in the 1900s were all solid fuel and Robert goddard came up with a three-stage plan to upgrade all combustion chamber

So they were much smaller, but more powerful and everyone was like yeah, yeah, but that's just plain impractical

It wasn't because that kick-started a turning point in rocketry in other worlds at war and we're all after new technology was this being used most notably by Germany

To land people in London in the graveyard and infirmary but world war  is over now

And everybody's eager to snap up the german scientists who pioneered the first V2 especially America who wanted to get humans into space

But then most rockets ran on Liquid  bought the bonus of them complex thrust adjustment and mass ratio or lack thereof America adopted these improvements

Then largely because Russia's getting pushy with their Star Nerd

He gives the soviets a Rocket modeled on the Reich's

V2 then spent some time in prison where he masterminds program to get people into orbit, but first animals make their debut

Woof woofski comrade laika cheers to you and  the us Meanwhile trying to beat them sending humans into space

Whoever wins will celebrate with bill borscht in any case And Nasa is doing pretty good with von Braun helping out with German Smarts

Right about then Russia's time for rocketry is finally here in 1961 Yuri Gagarin left the atmosphere

Returned to Earth as someone future astronauts would soon revere

Too bad he died soon after in a jet crash

America was soon to follow after with their own attempts and alan Shepard flew freedom 7 free of accidents

Though russia watch for vodka smokes and no doubt lashings of contempt

Now it's the u.s.'s turn for spacey tries at brave pre-empts

hey what's the big enormous white thing floating in the sky at night. Let's go see if that cures our frightful scientific appetite

Hey JFK stop riding around in open motorcades oh Jesus Christ!

America was sad, but the space race continued resolute then more disasters followed due to fire and twisted parachute Apollo 8 went great

didn't plan to did a  loop right moon, How's it going? BRB

We're going to walk on you

Then one year later Armstrong and buzz aldrin touch the lunar floor and mankind was united in a global truce

Forevermore my god we're all so tiny and what's all this fighting even for I?

Fuck it back to work

Hey Russia when's the next atomic war there five more missions landed on the moon and made it back again ignoring the  which suffered something

Of an accident and good news, Nasa all fundings cut so like no more spacing about for a bit

And that was the last time humans ever left earth orbit, so, that's good

Isn't it we've got plenty more important things to be doing like walking around collecting

Imaginary Japanese water demons on our phone very crucial to our species development

Team mystic represent by the way will bathe in the blood of our enemies

So now the u.s. Took the moon the russians cannot barely wait to get ahead or leave a legacy behind at any rate

Let's launch a bunch of space stations, then goodbye to the soviet state the iss was next up there and now we all collaborate

to explore the planets near and far

We mostly just use probes these days because space is kind of dangerous and full of deadly Cosmic Rays and human

explorations cool but probes are cheap and patience pays

and Juneau is now in Jupiter, but Mars gets or the Twitter praise well

Hopefully, we'll colonize the solar system sometime soon and take ourselves a greater or hovel on a martian moon lets pray

We just stay cool 'cause Total Recall didn't look much fun at all

Nasa's Budgets pretty small

But now there's a new

substitute because private

Corporations help our astronauts with their commute that's one small step for man next time it might be with a nikey boot and Elon Musk's

a cooler Tony stark with out the robot suit

We're doubtless

just beginning on our Journey on Beyond the skies for perils and delights my mind waves take us by surprise a message to our grandchildren

Let's hope you're more evolved and wise

But most of all good luck cause  heaven knows you'll fucking need it guys.


Title: A Tour of Academia - YouTube - English.txt
Oh hi.

Welcome to Academia.

Let's take a quick look around.

One of oldest and most famous cities in Academia is called philosophy.

Most of the people there spend their time writing papers, going to conferences, or ending

up as baristas.

That was a joke obviously.

No one in philosophy gets invited to conferences.

Now, if you head east across unemployable mountain, you eventually get to Physics and

Math.

Now you probably want to visit these if you're interested in numbers, precision, and a lifetime of

sexual abstinence.

Both have their own neighbourhoods, of course.

I'd recommend the quantum district but just be aware they've got a bit of a thing for

murdering cats, whatever that's all about.

Maths has its own weird parts of town, P and NP who are kind of at war at the moment.

There's also Geometry Island which is basically just lines.

Several hours dive away is astronomy, but I'd give it a miss.

Bit of a black hole if you know what I mean.

Engineering is quite nice, but they haven't really contributed much recently though to

be honest, just.. bridges, dams, turbines.

Oh and planes obvously.

And rockets.

And space stations, petroleum,, motors, telecommunications, electronics,,

and the industrial revolution.

Let's be honest, bunch of lazy pricks.

If you have a bit of extra time, just over Humanities River is literature, take a walk

round the Russian neighbourhoods, their police department is excellent, everyone's obsessed

with Crime and Punishment.

The American district is all right too, the weather's pretty brutal during the day but

Tender is the Night, and the British section isn't bad but just don't go in with any great

expectations, eh?

Just a few miles east is History.

Now they're good people, but they do seem to hang onto the past a bit.

Jesus just let it go guys, all right.

Linguistics is currently off limits at the moment with an outbreak of irritable vowel

syndrome.

But West Chomsky is very nice, lovely gnomes.

A few miles away there's the gender studies waterfall.

They're usually quite pushy about everyone checking their sunscreen.

And their privilege.

Just over Sarkeesian canyon we find education

I'd be very careful about visiting unless you're a fan of  incompetant idiot midgets.

I believe they're commonly referred to as children.

Psychology is an up and coming city, I'd recommend the Odeipus Rex district which is full of

milfs, Skinner Island, but just be sure to watch your behaviour, and the Milgram quarter,

but I'd avoid that one unless you want quite a shock.

And then there's there's sociology where everyone is so advanced that that they've stopped believing in

stupid old fashioned concepts like “proof”

Anthropology which is full of stalkers,

Theology, but Jesus Christ, those guys work religiously,

Economics.

There's supposedly treasure buried somewhere.

I don't know.

I guess X Marx the spot

Medicine, where the local pastime is being sued for trying to help people

Communication studies is a nice little break, be sure to give it your full attention and have

a proper gander.

Law is lovely.

You can take a left at smallprint avenue, a right onto litigation street, straight up

matrimonial highway and yeah, by the time you reach the fountain you'll find yourself

bankcrupt and paying for your ex's lawyer.

Back over unemployable mountain, just past film studies I'd advise finishing off your

trip with a visit to the Performing Arts, where the inhabitants are lovely, by my god

do they make a song and dance of everything.

Now the geology of Academia is quite interesting.

There are undergraduates at the top,

Then a sub layer of postgrads who have been severely crushed by geological pressure.

And life,

And finally the PHDs and staff who exist in a constant state of stress and have been turned

into human magma.

You'll know you've reached this level when you notice something wet and soggy draining

out of your ear one day and realise it's your soul.

So if all that sounds up your street, why not visit academia yourself?

I only came to avoid getting a real job and I've been trapped here for 9 years.

Did I say trapped?

I meant, having a lovely time.

It's like prison but the sex isn't as regular.


Title: Continue to Next Level_ - YouTube - English.txt
We are rather clever little machines.

If you throw in enough food and leave us a while eventually you get language, the printing

press, moon landings, instant mash potato, and Debbie Does Dallas

This is thanks to a nifty piece of hardware called brain.

It weighs about 5 percent of your body but takes in 20 percent of your calories.

Anyway, there is a problem.

The software keeps getting updated every few years thanks to culture, but the hardware

is exactly the same as it was back when we were savages.

Upgrades to the human CPU take about a few hundred thousand years even for small bug

fixes because evolution is very very slow.

But these restrictions might all be about to change in our lifetime and here’s why.

Quick version:

This is Ray Kurzweil.

He's a smart guy.

He's invented lots of stuff you've probably used yourself, and has written a bunch of books.

Now, he thinks human technology is getting better exponentially.

That means it's not getting better year by year, it's doubling at how much better it's

getting as it goes on.

So, if it keeps up at this rate he thinks, this century, we're going to get to a thing called the singularity.

It's a word borrowed from physics and it basically means that there will be a point when technology

is improving so fast, you can't even begin to imagine what the near future will look

like.

Rational Minibreak:

Before we get deeper into this, let's just admit that if there's one thing we're worse

at than not murdering each other it's predicting the future.

If you told a victorian that in about 100 years we'd all have this communications thing

in our pockets that gives you access to all human knowledge they might've said “Flaming

tallywags, tell what do you use it for?”

And if you're going to answer honestly, you'll say porn and cats.

And quite a lot more porn than cats.

In other words, we always expect utopia is coming and what we usually get is smarter

ways to do stupid stuff we've always been doing.

Anyway, let's imagine Ray Kurzweil is right and the singularity has happened.

Technology is improving so quickly we can't keep up with it.

What does the world look like?

Well, maybe we can answer that with an acronym: GRAIN.

This stands for genetics, robotics, AI, and nanotechnology, and even if only one of these

really takes off, that might mean the end of humanity as we know it.

So, for example if genetics gets pretty good, we're might start redesigning humans.

That means possibly removing stuff like mental illness, designer babies or splitting into

thousands of different species of humans.

It may've already started.

There's a very strange new technique called Crispr which means we might soon starting

editing the genes of human embryos.

Please go and watch Kurzgesagt's video  for a good explanation.

Or there’s robotics, which could revolutionise agriculture, and again humans.

O

Hey there.

Having trouble lifting stuff?

Yeah, I am actually.

How about robot arms?

Pretty cool eh?

Yeah, amazing!

Thanks!

And those legs look a bit tired.

Need an upgrade?

Oh, yes please.

Abracadabra, robot legs.

Wow, that's awesome!

And are you tired of those silly biological genitals?

What?

No, I like my genitals.

Please don't touch my genit

We can cut that little fella off in a second.

Hey presto, robot schlong

Aahhhhhhhhhhhhhh

Or artificial intelligence might get big, but I think we all know how that one might

pan out if it goes tits up.

Or nanotechnology.

Nanobots are little microscopic robots that hopefully will perform all sorts of complicated

tasks and make copies of themselves.

Just a quick doomsday scenario for you, say you make two nanobots, obviously they make

four in no time, then eight, then sixteen, thirty two, sixty four, one hundred twenty

eight, until you could convert the entire planet into nanomachines by the end of the

week.

And possibly, like, the universe a bit later?

So GRAIN, that’s the acronym to remember and it might mean the end of the world as

we know it.

Some of these technologies are coming and we’re going to put them in our bodies.

And if that happens to a large extent, are we human?

Or are we dancer

This the neocortex cortex.

It seems to be the main part of the brain that separates us from the rest of the mammals

as we have such a large one and it allows us to reason in an abstract way.

Some people think what we’re doing with our technology is kind of building another neocortex

but made of silicon.

We've already started outsourcing our brains to our technology.

When and IFFFF devices start being implanted inside the brain, it isn't technology anymore,

it might be the next step in the evolution of life itself.

And the humans using that technology won't be humans anymore in the traditional sense.

We will have started on our journey up the intelligence ladder to the next step in our

development.

Or nothing might happen and the future will be incredibly boring. But that seems unlikely. All right, real talk for a minute.

We're probably mostly wrong about what the future will look like.

We usually are.

But if only 5% of this stuff happens , IF, it will be bigger than the printing press,

than the internet, bigger than fire even. And it might mean extinction or the birth of a

new species of human but one thing is for sure. If it happens, we'll get to see the

beginning of it at least.

We might already be watching it without realising.

There's no telling what we're going to turn ourselves into but there's every reason to

think it's part of a natural process.

Just because it's technology that we're going to use to evolve this time, doesn't mean it

wasn't always going to happen.

This might be how species develop in the universe, first through biology, then through technology

and then something else entirely maybe.

The future we live in today was unimaginable to our ancestors but at least we're the same

species as them.

Tomorrow's humans might be not be the same species, and stranger than that, they might

look back on our situation with the same regard we give to primates or even single celled life.

life. Genetics, robotics, AI, and nanotechnology and whatever else we invent, might rewrite the rules of biology.

Every step we've taken has been on the outside so far, exploring our planet, exploring the

universe.

It’s different this time.

This might be the first adventure that goes inwards instead.

But we have a lot of bosses to beat before we can get to the next level.

We’ve got doomsday weapons, deadly contagions, possible climate catastrophe, political tensions

and god knows what else.

But if we make it through all that, if we turn into whatever new species we're going

to become, it's probably going to be incredible.

Our descendants might one day look back on this century and think how amazing it was that

considering how violent and stupid we were sometimes, that we managed to do so much with so

little, and that in spite of all the odds against us, we survived anyway and turned

into something better and wiser, whatever that happens out to be.


Title: Why is the Milk Gone_ - YouTube - English.txt
Motherfuc-

Why is the milk gone?

Well because you forgot to buy milk, alright?

And why did you forget to buy milk?

Well.

That's an interesting question.

See you were gonna some on the way home yesterday but then you remembered

you had to get some bread as well so you went to the bread aisle.

However the alcohol aisle was on the way to the bread aisle so you went there first because

recently you've been doing quite a lot of drinking alone (if by recently you mean the

last 12 years) and they had this new 45% bourbon which was pretty cool, which you bought and

then forgot to buy milk.

So really the milk is gone because of whisky.

But really you only went to buy whisky because it's kind of been a cloudy day and you wanted

to cheer yourself up a bit.

And it's only really been a cloudy day because of temperature differential over the balkan

peninsula, brought on by east moving winds and pressure fluctuations.

So really the milk is gone because of the weather.

But the weather is only really there because of the atmosphere which formed about 4 billion

years ago, as a result of gas escaping from the Earth's interior.

So the milk is gone because of the Earth.

But the Earth is only really there because a gas cloud condensed into the sun and the solar

system a few billion ago.

And all of that came from the big bang, billions of years before that. So really the milk is

gone because space and time materialized out of apparently nothing... 14 billion years ago.

And if that's true did the universe know 14 billion years ago that if she exploded, formed

into galaxies and stars and they gave rise to planets and the planets developed ecosystems,

single celled life, complex organisms, humans, human society, domestication of cows,

the invention of coffee, milk in coffee, fridges and finally you, that you that you would eventually

run out of milk, fourteen billion years later?

Well... maybe.

If you're playing pool or snooker or whatever and you hit the ball at a certain angle at

a certain speed, if you have a good enough computer you could say exactly where the balls

are going to go, right?

It's all predetermined.

If you took exactly the same shot a thousand times the balls would do the same thing a

thousand times.

Well, if the big bang happened a thousand times over just the way it did 14 billion

years would you run out of milk a thousand times 14 billion years later?

And doesn't that mean you entire life is already determined, like the date of your birth and

death was already predicted the moment the universe came into being and everything has

to happen in a certain order, just that way, just like a pool game?

No, definitely not.

We've got free will, right?

I mean, just because the universe is made of atoms bumping into each other that have

to act in a certain way based on what happened before and just because your brain is made

of atoms that have to do the same thing and it's all part of the same system, you can

still just decide to do stuff, right?

Because otherwise we're just balls in a cosmic game of pool with no free will at all...meaning

we're just robots caught in a deterministic system with just an illusion of choice but

really having no control whatsoever over our own lives deluding ourselves into thinking

we're somehow different to all the other atoms in the universe and that would mean you've

never made a real choice and you never will and whatever you decide to do next in life

isn't a decision at all but was always going to happen and there's no point to ever doing

anything ever again because everything was predecided at the beginning of time and life

is completely meaningless and empty and – fuck it  black coffee is fine.


Title: An Open Letter from Exurb1a to YouTube - YouTube - English.txt
Hi, Youtube just a quick note from a relatively small channel. Couldn't help notice you've started punishing content creators by restricting advertising on anything that

Might be Vulgar or sexually suggestive. Just wanted to say it's about time and channels making content like that can suck a dick

The only reason YouTube got so big was because it was television, but without the censorship

It seems like a great idea to now turn the  into a safe advertising space free of anything outrageous like humor wit

Controversy or fun hopefully you can drive all the big creators away by Christmas, anyway

I'm off to start shooting a makeup tutorial shit balls horse minge. Love and kisses xavier


Title: 5 Questions for Nature - YouTube - English.txt
you

hello hi is that nature no he's kind of

busy at the moment

hey get back over here daddy's feeling

acrobatic again sorry can you put nature

on who's calling please

as humanity oh just just a second then

yeah it's the monkeys oh yeah this is

nature how did you even get this number

it's the first ten digits of pi

Comcast yeah have you got a second to

talk

well I'm literally running everything at

the moment so frankly we've got a few

pressing questions okay oh Jesus

lights is pretty fast

like this fast and thus the fastest

anything can go according to Albert

Einstein why actually while we're on the

subject why is anything set up like that

why's gravity this strength why do prime

numbers go in that distribution is

Firefly ever coming back what decided

molecules were bond in the way they do

hmm

hmm why the laws of physics the way they

are do they have to be like that or is

it just one form they can take is this

the only type of universe that can be

made or just one variation of

potentially billions this is called

Tubby's star it's nice isn't it stars

are really far away so if you want to

look for planets around them what you

have to do is wait for the planet to

pass in front of it and learn about it

from the light it blocks right well lots

of objects keep passing in front of tapi

style and make no sense

they aren't planets anyway there might

be fragments of comets they might be

something natural we don't understand

but whatever it is we haven't seen

anything like this before

might sir might be aliens if you're an

alien civilization and you're really

clever you probably need lots of energy

well the smart thing to do is to build

what's called a Dyson swarm which are a

load of machines orbiting a star for

sucking up all of this energy we might

be witnessing that we might not pretty

weird though whatever it is actually

while we're on the subject where are all

the aliens exactly the universe has been

around for ages life started fine on

earth why is it so quiet out there well

maybe they're not using radio waves

we've only been using them for just over

a century maybe they found another type

of communication or maybe they walk

among us already

in any case tabby star is kind of weird

we don't understand why it's behaving

like that and right now it's a fun

mystery we don't really know what

consciousness is but we know what the

ingredients are to humans who can at

least tolerate each other for a few

minutes about nine months and food and

for some reason that gives rise to

self-awareness this doesn't know it's a

thing this doesn't know it's a thing why

does this know it's a thing I want to

keep being a thing here's the deal then

we kind of know what different parts of

the brain do this does the planning and

the boohoo's this does movement vistors

looking about and stuff this does memory

and perception but that doesn't seem to

be a consciousness section of the brain

where does it come from exactly and how

does it work and is it a thing that has

to be made of meat or can it be

reproduced on other stuff like computers

the point is we don't know right now how

meat feels like an eye if you put it

together in the right way but for some

reason it does why

why did life happen on earth can it

happen again on other planets

we have no idea the origin of life is

called abiogenesis and much like penis

enlargement pills we've never seen the

real thing we just talk about it a lot

so is it a freak accident or a natural

progression given the right environment

if it's an accident we might be the only

ones even though that seems a little

unlikely if it happens a lot again where

are all the aliens and why do amino

acids naturally assemble themselves into

humans eventually and how and why do

they do it

we don't know but here you are millions

of years of evolution got you to this

point are you making the most of it

personally I spend the last week eating

biscuits and looking at photos of Margot

Robbie over 90 percent of the universe

is invisible why what does that even

mean some of the invisible stuff is

called dark matter we know it's there

for one thing because galaxies look kind

of weird but dark matter doesn't give

off any lights as you may have guessed

in the name which is weird because

that's not how matter usually behaves

the other stuff is called dark energy we

know it's there because the expansion of

the universe is slowing down right

because that's how stuff works oh wait

no it isn't at all is speeding up

because well because it just is right

and that's because if dark energy and we

have no idea what that means dark matter

and dark energy are basically just blank

checks right now to explain away stuff

we don't understand it might be they're

not real at all and we're just wrong

about gravity it might not still yeah

why yeah good questions we'll have to do

this again sometime oh right it's like

that is it we're not gonna get any

answers then you're doing fine don't

worry about it see you around her yeah

just one more thing well we've got you

on the phone yep just out of interest

yes can aging be reversed

what I have no idea and why does

antimatter exist

I don't know and why is there such a big

difference between human intelligence

and the rest of the animal kingdom well

I really don't know and why is there

something rather than nothing and we

alone in the universe and is space

infinite and why do we blush and why do

brain freezers happen and yeah sorry

just got another call waiting ten

seconds

hello asteroids Department yeah they're

getting clever again remember the

dinosaur thing

we need another one of those


Title: How You&#39;re Probably Going to Die - YouTube - English.txt
The most common cause of death is called dying, and it kills about 55 million of us each year.

That’s about one South Africa or two hundred star destroyers.

And good news, it's your turn next because you've just become a competitor in the suicide

Olympics.

Bet you didn't even know that was a thing, eh?

The rules of the suicide Olympics are as follows:

First place goes to whoever gets themselves killed in the most unlikely or unusual fashion,

okay?

The winner gets a bilion dollars.

Now this isn't Zimbabwe dollars or something, this is hard, American moolah.

Obviously if you win, you're dead, so you don't get the money personally.

Your family does.

So, let's just pretend you give a shit about your family for a minute.

The twist is that it has to be an accident.

You can't set it up in advance.

So no flying a kite in a lightning storm or playing whose gun is it anyway with a policeman

or something, it has to be an accident out of your control.

Now, if like me, you're balls to the wall scared of flying you might think hey that's

easy, I'll just fly crappy airlines, and wait for something to go wrong, right?

Yyeeeeeeno.

The odds of being in a fatal plane crash are about 1 in eleven million meaning if you flew

every single day you've need to live about 30,000 years to actually get into an accident.

So that's not gonna butter any parsnips is it?

Well, next best thing, become an astronaut.

That's about a 1 in 100 chance of dying on launch, that sounds a lot better, but considering

you'll need at least a master's degree, practically perfect health, and testicles made entirely

of steel, maybe that might be a bit of a challenge.

All right?

Bungee jumping – 1 in 100,000

Mountain climbing?

Mm, about 1 in 1700.

Yeah, but in Nepal?

how about 1 in 160.

Actually, if you get above 6000m it's more like 1 in 10.

Oh holla, now we're talking.

But maybe you think that's cheating.

Normal people don't climb mountains.

How about travel instead?

About 1000 people are killed each year in Mexico by scorpions,

15,000 people are killed in India every year by snakes,

Or move to Africa.

That's a hippo.

Intimidating it isn't.

Well yes it is actually.

Hyppos belong from the pachyderm family, which is in fact latin, for murder cow and during

a particularly bad year they can kill around 3000 people.

But still your best chance of dying is probably just to....live?

Because we suck at it.

Last century about a hundred million people were killed by tobacco.

Likewise, if you're fat, pardon me, a person of weight, well, obesity killed about 300,000

people in the US last year.

88,000 died by booze related stuff.

Several hundred thousand to drug abuse,

And on top of that, cancer kills about 1 in 7 of us,

Heart disease kills about half that,

A stroke gets 1 in 23.

All of this proving that probably everything your scared of is very unlikely to actually

kill you.

Chances are your death is going to be incredibly boring . So, chin up, eh?

Actually, while we're at it, what about the odds of you just being born to begin with?

Well, according to Dr. Ali Binazir who did the math on this one, pretty like low?

Assuming your parents socialised like normal humans, The probability of them meeting

was about 1 in 20,000

The odds that they even have a kid, given global trends?

About 1 in 2,000

Now assuming they did meet, and your mum thought your dad wasn't a jerk, and he managed to

ignore the fact that she considered the star wars prequels better than the originals, and

they actually did the sexy times, the odds that you would be born, of that sperm

hooking up with that egg – in particular are about 1 in 400.

Quadrillion.

And that's not even the half of it, because before the egg, before your mum and dad met,

there is of course all of your ancestors who also had to get laid, and

just taking that about 100,000 generations back, we're talking about 10 to the power

of 45,000 that they would all meet, but now we have to calculate the odds of every single

one of those 100,000 meetings between your ancestors would work out, and those sperms

and eggs would match up, well that comes out at about 1 in ten to the power of 2,640,000

which is a number so big you can't even, well you know like a bag of m&ms?

Well, it's a few trillion of those.

Timesed by all the particles in the universe.

Multipled by Jabba the hut's waist measurement.

With a cherry on top.

It's big all right.

All in all, flying is pretty safe, your death is going to be boring, and your birth was

rarer than a fucking mewtwo

Au Revoir


Title: The Term Paper - YouTube - English.txt
okay turn paper due in tomorrow 3,000

words that's easy I'll add it the to-do

list

turn paper also take the rubbish out get

mega big to watch the entire new season

the black mirror no no distractions

it's okay you got plenty of time so

what's the term paper about American

space program don't know anything about

the American space program or face

program what is that oh it's a game just

download it might be educational great

okay put that there and that there and

no need to do the term paper two more

minutes all right let's try okay how

about a this is actually kind of fun

this is actually really fun wait can I

get to the moon

ha easy peasy take that NASA take that

the 60s

take that unflinching scientific

curiosity you dick

getting late mmm days kind of over

now might as well call it a night

note do the term paper there isn't time

maybe just have a quick drink bit of a

pick-me-up

hmm not bad yeah don't feel quite so

stressed out anymore feel pretty bloody

good actually how does alcohol what ie

if you don't do the turn paper they'll

kick you off the course

uh yeah yeah yeah if I don't do this I

fail the course but so what well then

you don't graduate and you don't get the

career you want but don't we all just

die anyway what's the point are we all

going to be gone in a century

aren't our grandchildren gonna die too

isn't the Sun going to consume the earth

in the solar system and eventually all

the stars will wink out into oblivion

until the entire universe that comes the

heat death and then there's nothing left

forever infinitely in all directions

with no hope of recovery and no one to

remember our pitifully short time on the

planet isn't this all ultimately nothing

just a futile scream into the void

before going quietly into oblivion could

just commit suicide that would solve the

old term paper dilemma would I really do

that just to a voice working

no life must have intrinsic meaning look

at all that beauty look at all of our

accomplishments look at how much there

is to live for think of the thousands of

years of progress ahead of us of

journeying to the stars of throwing off

the shackles of ignorance discovering

the inner workings of matter of

eventually living in harmony with the

cosmos and the other species on the

planet think about the odds of you just

being born to begin with the whole

universe ultimately conspired to make

you course this purpose to life be

reasonable about this

stay calm get your  done there's

still plenty of time alright so here

goes

turn paper

4,000 words will  this I'm putting

my head in the oven


Title: Where Be Aliens_ - YouTube - English.txt
Oh look, it’s no aliens.

No aliens there.

No aliens there.

And just over here, a distinct lack of aliens.

In any case there are three fairly good reasons why they probably still haven’t said hello yet

yet.

And they are as follows.

The first is technology.

Lots of scientists are searching the skies for messages from aliens in the form of radio

waves.

We've had radio waves for about a century.

Our species has been around for about 1.5 million years so that's about 0.005 % of how long

we’ve been on the planet or you know, this.

Just here.

Yeah, that’s you and.... your pathetic life.

Radio is the best we've got at the moment, but do you really want to bet it's the best

mode of communication we'll always have forever?

What if, in say, a thousand years, just here, we discover another mode of communication?

Imagine you're an ape living in the forest and one day you decide there must be other,

smarter apes out there so you start trying to communicate with them.

What would you do?

Probably everything you know how to.

Shout a bit.

Throw shit.

Give up.

Much like my recent experiences with the Bulgarian immigration office.

And all that time, you're going to be missing the fact that there are smarter hairless apes

out there, billions of them, flying right over you in big metal birds, and transmitting

magic waves straight through your body without you ever knowing.

Because, frankly, the idea is just too far out for your little ape brain right now

So, we're about here, with technology we've had for this long, and we're expecting all

aliens to be here too.

In reality, if they've probably been around for longer than we have, they might be here,

using technology we can’t even imagine right now.

The second problem is smarts and it's even harder to get around.

Every time we send out a Hi?

Into the cosmos it assumes aliens would even give a shit about talking to us in the first

place.

We'd like to think they would.

I mean look at all of our fascinating culture.

Look at all of our noble accomplishments.

Look at the wonderful feats we're capable of. Look at all of the fantastic things we have to boast about.

The thing is, and I've covered this one before in a video about AI, how much of shit do we

give about species on our own planet less intelligent than us?

We're certainly not trying to teach them how to do calculus or play the accordion.

Why?

Because you're lovely, Charles Bonobo ape, congratulations on evolving this far, Mr.

Johnny Crow face, but you’re both going to suck as a wingman.

You don’t even have an alphabet or pornography yet.

No offense but evolve a bit then we’ll chat yeah?

Likewise, if you're some smart arse alien civilisation who has discovered antigravity

and hangover free alcohol, how much would you really have to say to primitive warring monkeys who

still haven't even cracked immortality?

Sup.

How's war and social media and still using toilet paper working out for you?

Yeah, let's chat again when you’re not still total idiots, eh?

Ciao.

And that's also ignoring the problem that their brains might not even be wired remotely

like ours.

If they have brains.

Their language – if they have a language – might be so difficult to speak – if

it's spoken – that we can't even reply – if they write to us in the first place.

Just look at the diversity of life on Earth.

Anyone speak dolphin?

No?

I’ve got a GCSE in Spanish if that helps.

That's the second problem, intelligence, and it relies on us finding other species who

are at almost exactly the same point in development as us.

That is, slightly above flinging our own faeces, but still trying to blow each other up.

The final problem, my personal favourite, is extinction and this is kind of the one

to worry about.

One answer to: if the universe is so big, where be aliens though?

Is, well...

70 years ago or so we discovered nuclear weapons.

There are now around 15,000 warheads on the planet, capable of obliterating life a few

times over.

This has happened in 7 decades.

In the entire history of technology we went from a bit mouthy but most harmless to could

wipe themselves and everything else out in just under an hour . And that's just one technology

we've discovered.

Do you wanna bet we're not going to find more?

Doesn't even have to be weaponry.

There might be something built into physics for example where species accidentally create

black holes or some other deadly event, or incurable superbugs, or that giant Yellowstone

tit thing going off, not to forget all the methane under the ocean, solar flares that

could roast our entire civilisations with only a few minutes warning, or just another

asteroid like the one that wiped out the dinosaurs or just anything along those lines.

If other species are out there, they’re probably facing, or have faced, the same threats.

It might be that only 1% of civilisations get through that window and evolve into peace-loving-tech-monkeys

at the other end.

Or it might be 0% explaining why no one's out there returning our calls.

So, that's the happy haps.

Where be aliens?

Probably dead/too evolved/too far away/busy playing civ 6.

Steam handle exurb1a by the way.

Because to even get a reply back we might need to be at exactly the right point in technological

development, sending messages that actually appear smart enough, to civilisations who

haven't already fucking wiped themselves out.

If it makes you feel any better, keep in mind we’re the smartest, most intellectual, sophisticated,

and sentient, creatures we’ve found in the entire universe so far.

Then again you also began life as an orgasm

Stay humble

Bye.


Title: Brilliant Accidents - YouTube - English (United Kingdom).txt
I'd like to introduce you to a mate of mine

His name is Entropy

Now it's his job to wind the universe down

And he's been doing that since... well... the big bang, and he's actually rather good at it.

Thanks to him, as time has gone on, the universe has been moving towards total disorder

And one day, probably, the whole universe will power down.

It might just fade out, or it might keep expanding out into infinite space

Whatever that even means

But, in any case, one day, it's all gonna be game over I'm afraid

SOZZLES

But there is another side to this

Entropy's mate, Complexity, has a different job

She's been hard at work since the beginning of time as well

And she's more or less responsible for... well...

Everything we like anyway, including stars, planets...

That galaxy that looks like it's swearing

Hotpockets

The Kama Sutra

And, of course, the human race

Entropy and complexity are working as hard today as they've ever been

The galaxy is still winding down and taking whole galaxies with it

And burning the stars out, and melting the ice in your whiskey

But complexity is operating alongside, and stars are still being born

And thanks to us, things are still getting more complex, on earth anyway

And I mention all of this for a reason...

The universe appears to be a bit meaningless, as I have pointed out six- or seven thousand times already

And that's fine

There's a good word: Telos, which means 'The ultimate aim of something; where it's going.'

For those of you on Team God, well religion has already given you the telos for the universe.

God put it here, presumably.

But for everyone else, there isn't a telos really.

The universe is just here to wind down, thanks to entropy.

And that can be a bit bloody depressing at times.

But maybe there is a telos behind that

Insightful piano music

The universe started as physics. Chemistry was built on top of that, then biology

And, at the very top, would you look at that

It's the universe's favourite bipedal hominids: us.

As far as we know, you are the most complex thing the cosmos has done to date

But complexity doesn't come for free.

If you want to freeze water, making it more organized, you'll need a freezer.

And for that little bit of order, lots of disorder is produced, just by the freezer running in the first place.

A lot of disorder for a little order.

Likewise, if you want to make plants and sea lions and talking monkeys on Earth

You'll need millions of years of the sun slowly wearing itself out

Again increasing the overall entropy of the universe

A lot of disorder for a little order.

Nevertheless, if alien telescopes looked for complexity rather than light

They would see a universe moving towards total disorder

But just tucked away in an obscure patch of the Milky Way

They'd probably find these little, adorable, miniature...

Hairless... rather aggressive, warmongering, suicidal, nuclear apes

A little bibble of complexity holding out against a universe of increasing entropy

It's easy to feel lonely when we look out into space, and maybe we are alone

But our entire species is the direct result of a conversation that's been going on between entropy and complexity

Since the birth of time itself

One day, stars will stop being born, and galaxies will collide or collapse

And entropy will almost certainly increase to maximum

But, in the meantime, there have been some rather neat developments

Even if they are just byproducts.

Us being one of them

And that seems like a rather nice telos for the universe. And for us.

Even if creation is only here to wind down, and there's no purpose to any of it, and nothing means anything after all

Our species is, as far as we know right now, at the top of the complexity pyramid...

Holding out against relentless entropy.

And that is what could be called, in scientific terms

A pretty fucking privileged position.

Happy New Year, you bloody animals.

Have a good one.

Contemplative piano music


Title: A Guide to Worrying - YouTube - English.txt
So, you're worried about a thing, are you?

Might be a bill you can't pay, might be a job interview.

Might be your career falling apart. Whatever.

But the best thing you can do in this situation is just to think about it as much as possible.

Don't do anything about it.

Just make sure keep worrying because that always makes problems go away.

Look at all those people.

Whatever you're worrying about must be a million times worse than anything they can imagine.

They've definitely never had to face a personal crisis.

I'm sure they never felt lonely, been sued, lost family members, spouses, children.

They probably never been fired, or been in love with someone who didn't love them back

or paniced about their career, or anything most humans go through in a lifetime.

Because whatever you're worried about is definitely the biggest thing that has ever happened to anyone. Ever.

No one has ever been to war so they wouldn't understand what you're going through.

They haven't approached Omaha Beach and known they are probably going to be dead in a few minutes.

No one has ever been trapped in a damaged spacecraft, thousands of miles from the earth, running out of oxygen

No one has had to face constant bombing from the air that turned up without warning.

Somehow whatever it is recently you've got on your mind, that justifies you loosing sleep.

And being a total dick to yourself.

Well, you know best. Luckily humans live forever and never age.

So dont worry, you've got infinite time to hold yourself back with doubts.

And actually it's worse than that.

You know, if the bad thing does happen,

where you dont get the job or you emberass yourself somehow

we're all gonna be laughing at you.

All seven billion of us

We don't have our own lifes, or relationships, or children, or careers.

We're just waiting to see you fuck up.

The entire planet is going to turn up at your house and write "lol" on your door. In piss.

That's what's gonna happen.

And even after you're dead we're going to errect a shrine on your grave that says:

"This person made a mistake."

and we'll visit it everyday with flowers.

But not the nice ones. Like petrol station roses.  That we've found in a bin.

And don't even think about taking any creative risks.

That project you're working on, the book, or the movie or the video, or whatever

If you screw up any of it we're gonna laugh at you because we're certanly not busy worrying about our own lifes.

Homer, Beethoven, Tolstoi, Hitchcock, Tarantino... None of them ever worried about their careers.

Just keep sabotaging yourself so you don't have to ever fear doing something original.

That's the save path.

Same with doing what you love, actually.

No one has ever taken a risk before.  You're the first one to do it. Ever.

And I'm sure the universe  cares if you screw up or take a risk.

It definitely isn't busy regulating the speed of light or, you know, keeping the galaxies from fucking colliding!

In fact the entirety of creation was just designed to watch you fail personally.

That's what we're all doing here.

That's what get's us up in the moring.

You.

Failing.

Maybe just spend the rest of your life fixated on worrying

instead of ever doing anything ever again

instead of say becoming the best possible version of yourself and being kind to people

and taking wild and bold risks that scare you and will probably pay off some other time.

and living a lasting legacy for your great-grandchildren

so they can say that one of their ancestors in the early 21st century

was undeniably a bad motherfucker and did something brilliant

or was just a half decent human being who decided that the point of being alive

was to party as much as possible  before the lights go out.

And just to be nice to other humans.

Probably better just to keep your head down.  Don't rock the boat.

Can't risk emberassing yourself.

But none of that really matters, does it?

Because you're worried about that thing, aren't you?

Might be a bill you can't pay, might be a job interview.

Might be your career falling apart. Whatever.

But the best thing you can do in this situation is just to think about it as much as possible.

Don't do anything about it.

Just make sure keep worrying because no one has ever been in a bad situation before. Ever.

And I'm sure, whatever it is, is very important and won't ever go away.

Just like all the other things you used to worry about before.

And now can't even remember


Title: [English] Making Stuff [DownSub.com].txt
So one day you have an idea and you decide to make a thing.

Might be an app, movie, business, video game...

Might be a painting of your own willy, done entirely in toothpaste.

Whatever.

Now, you probably start with some good stats.

Maybe plus 10 creativity, plus 15 charisma, plus 20 self-esteem.

Well, that's grand.

You also have a map, showing the way to your thing.

Look, there it is. A straight line.

So off you trot, and everything is going great, only...

Okay, minor difficulties, because you don't actually know how to do your thing yet.

Obviously you need to learn to code, or write, or use a camera, or whatever.

I mean, okay. There is a small wiggle in the map, but so what?

When your project is done, which will be in like a month, it's going to be great.

Remember that.

You'll just work really hard. It's fine.

Oh, what? Here comes another hitch.

Maybe you're tired in the evenings when you get back from work and

you don't wanna spend all your time on your project, but that's okay.

Keep going, you'll be alright.

Nothing worth doing was ever easy, huh?

Oh, okay. Money trouble slash no time.

But don't worry, it's alright. And... I... Yes, sorry, that's -

[Minus 10 points determination]

But carry on, and... Okay, trouble at work.

Don't worry about it. You'll be alright.

[Minus 15 emotional resolve]

Hey, you can use all that sad energy to make something really brilliant.

[Plus 15 angst]

Yeah, screw the naysayers, screw mrs. Collins in year 5

and all that bullshit she said about your crappy work ethic.

Here comes the big time, captain.

It's just around the corner, hopefully.

All right. It's been months now and you haven't made much progress and...

Jesus Christ, does that line have a lot of wiggles in it. But just - you're going to be fine.

Remember that thing you're trying to finish. Whatever it was, it's going-

It's going to be great.

You're broke and you haven't seen your friends in weeks, but look:

you've started now, so you better bloody well finish.

Okay. There are a lot of problems with the project.

Coding is quite hard as it turns out, or

some days you just don't want to write, or

starting a business with very little money is extremely tiring.

Just hang in there, and-
[Minus 20 determination]

[Minus 15 self-esteem]

[Minus 10 will to live]

Just keep working. It's all right.

(God, why did you even start this?)
[Minus 10 self-esteem]

No, just shut up. Stop being so hard on yourself, idiot. You never do anything right.

[Minus 20 self-esteem.]
God this is just so typical.

You're always chasing after stupid pipe dreams that'll never work.
[Minus 30 self-esteem]

This is probably why dad never bought you that fucking Etch-a-sketch.
[Minus 100 self-esteem]

And- oh... That's nice. It's a chance meeting with a friend who says some wise things.

They've been through hard times and they're still alive.

Keep going, they tell you. You'll be all right.

Plus 50 self-esteem.

That's ironed out a few kinks and

You're a little further along now.

It's funny, while the thing was only in your head, you didn't really imagine there would be any problems.

Who would have thought coding or an app or starting a business

or making a documentary would be so difficult.

Well, you know all about that now.

Plus 20 wisdom

Super Duper.

Of course there was going to be resistance.

Of course people were going to tell you it's impossible.

Well, you'll show them and boy are people going to love this shit when you're done.

Everything is going to be alright after all.

Maybe good things do happen.

Maybe everything is going to turn out fantastically.

Maybe you're going to live in a mansion and spend all day eating Cadbury's creme eggs

and watching Amelie over and over.

Maybe CrossFit is actually good for you.

And maybe-
[skeptical comments from friends and family]

[Minus 50 determination]

Oh it's fine. What do they know?
[No funding slash money]

[Minus 50 determination]

Hang in there. It's okay. This thing is going to be great.

Carry on and maintain your resolve. What's the wors-

(God. Am I secretly an idiot for believing in my own ambition?)

[Minus 50 resistance to mockery]

(Maybe everything Mrs. Collins said in year five was true.)

[Minus 500 self-esteem]

But- Oh, thank god. Just a little further now.

Look how far you've come. You're home and dry.

The manuscript is almost finished.

Or the documentary is almost shot.

Or the business is almost set up

and the toothpaste is perfectly aligned.

All that effort is going to pay off and everything is going to be fine.

And only a few more steps. My god, if you'd only know what you're getting into.

But surely it can't get any worse.

Surely this is the final hurdle and just a few steps away is...

Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! FUCK!

Oh and here comes a health crisis: bout of weight gain.

Your family expects you to settle down already.

Other friends having good jobs.

No energy. No fun. No money. And the undeniable sense that you're wasting your time.

The map is fucked! You should have gone to law school.

You're in over your head. The whole world is waiting for you to fail.

It's all been done before. There are no new ideas.

Move to the woods, eat rice and die alone.

My god you're getting older. No one will give a damn when you're finished with this.

And how did you get into this mess and why try anything when it's doomed to fail?

What does fun feel like again? What does having free time feel like again?

*Crash cymbals intensifies*
Did Tony Robbins lie about everything?

*Drums intensifies*

*CYMBAL!*

And one day, unexpectedly, you wake up to find, in spite of all the odds

that your project is indeed finished.

And maybe it was good and successful, or maybe people said mean things

but you learned a shitload in the process.

And you know now that in order to shit fire, one must first chew glass.

That has been the prerequisite for almost all great art, and endeavour and invention.

All of the great writers, scientists, pioneers, entrepreneurs and generally decent humans

had a hard time doing stuff.

They hated their work, doubted themselves, lost friends, made enemies, spent years broke.

But the single common theme is they may have screwed up a few times.

Usually a lot.

But they always kept their eye on whatever it was they wanted to finish.

And when that thing was finished, they went on to the next project.

That appears to be how the game works.

Or... Okay, to put it another way...

Projects are hard, self-doubt isn't clever,

so make lots of stuff before you're dead forever.

Goodbye.


Title: [English] Digital Hygiene_ How We Might've Fucked Our Attention Spans [DownSub.com].txt
Most of us have fucked our attention spans,

I reckon

and I'm going to suggest a remedy.

Like me, until recently, you may find that while you planned to have a productive Saturday,

you instead spent it on

Youtube,

and Facebook,

and Agar.io,

and ﻿o t h e r  s i t e s,

and got nothing done.

WHY?

Well, it's because the internet is absurdly addictive, and can cater to anything,

ANYTHING,

you want to see.

And that's wonderful.

However...

At the advanced, practically terminal age of twenty-seven,

I remember a time when the internet was a luxury.

And if you were on the internet, friends couldn't phone your house, so you used it sparingly.

People in chatrooms were polite, (usually), even the creepy old men, because it felt like you were part of some new frontier

that was going to change the world.

The Net was a tool back then that you usually only turned on to do something specific with

and it was, amazing.

Now, the Net is incredibly sophisticated, and you can do bloody anything with it.

However, this also came with a downside that looked like an upside.

Which is that most of us are permanently connected to it, via our phones.

Just as I am guilty of, you may find that in the morning, before even brushing your teeth, or making a cup of coffee, you check your e-mails.

And if you think about it, that's kind of fucking crazy.

You may have also noticed,

again, like me,

that reading books, or listening to a whole album, or just trying to learning a new skill that doesn't involve a screen,

is substantially more difficult than it used to be.

And half way through, you just give up and check Reddit,

over,

and over,

for no good reason.

(shoutout to /r/accidentalrenaissance)

So here's my baseless conjecture.

I reckon the Net, and phones in general, have seriously diminished human attention spans,

to the point where we now expect almost immediate gratification for performing tasks.

And when a book gets a bit boring, as they usually do,

or playing an instrument is tough, or we get stuck alone with our own thoughts,

...god forbid...

we switch to doing something mediocre online rather than persevering with something difficult in the real world.

That is un-good.

So, around a month ago, I thought,

"Well, this is jolly silly,"

and set some ground rules.

For the next month, I'd spend an hour in the morning answering e-mails, quickly check the news, check my life online,

(because that is my job)

but then I'd just unplug the router for the rest of the day.

And I didn't plug it back in until the next morning.

I went and bought a load of books I've been meaning to read for ages,

made an effort to go see friends in the evening,

and every Saturday or so I'd go back through my subscriptions and have a watch of Youtubers I was really into.

And the internet began to feel like a treat again.

For the first day, or two, it was a bit weird,

and I could feel there was a kind of instinct to reach for my laptop everytime I felt bored.

But soon enough your brain works out that there's no point, because it knows it's:

No Wifi o'clock motherfucker!

And sure enough, tasks requiring concentration get easier, because you learn that you can't just escape into the lovely, fuzzy, warm oblivion of the internet.

And on top of that, you realize, or I certainly did, that for a very long time now, you've been sacrificing productive time,

or just an hour to have a think about your life,

for the sake of watching something you don't really give a shit about, out of fear of being bored.

Fast food is delicious, but you're not supposed to eat it for *every fucking meal*!

If you'd'te describe the internet to anyone before the nineties, they would have assumed we'd be living in a techno-utopia, and that everything would be amazing.

And like all technology, they probably wouldn't have predicted,

that this big lovely binary cake comes with some downsides.

Now we have two personas to manage, our real one, and our digital one.

Snail mail has been replaced with digital mail,

(which people get angry with if you don't answer immediately),

and instantaneous transfer of information has given rise to immediate boredom with anything that doesn't have a hook in the first ten seconds.

Try it.

For a month, or just a week, use the internet as a tool again, rather than a source of constant gratification, if that's what you're doing now.

Set some rules. If you work from home, download a site blocker.

Take up a hobby in the outside world that you've always wanted to.

Start watercolour painting!  (Pinky promise, it's worth it)

More than that, there's probably something you've always wanted to get into, or a project you've always wanted to finish.

Why not do it now?

You'd be amazed what you can concentrate on when you're suddenly not obliged to check what everyone's been having for lunch that day,

or what certain presidents have been tweeting recently.

It's a bit worrying if this is a growing trend.

I know people who can't sit through movies without playing Candy Crush or checking Twitter.

Games, and the Net, are only going to get more alluring as time goes on.  The problem isn't going away.

We're getting extremely good at hijacking the reward centers of human brains.

Combine that with virtual reality, or whatever's coming next, and that is a kind of scary prospect.

In the same way that you wash your hands after using the toilet,

*HOPEFULLY*

we might one day start teaching digital hygiene, where we all learn to keep our concentration on one thing at a time, rather than running 10,000 tabs all at once,

ALL OF WHICH ARE CATS

So, for a month, I dare you to step back from the Net, and go after whatever it is that you've always wanted to do in real life, but couldn't find the time.

Read some books, learn to bake,

get your camel riding license,

whatever.

Attention is a resource, and we only have a limited supply,

and it's silly to spend that resource on things that may temporarily stop us from being bored, but don't really provide any mental nourishment.

...Much like my Youtube content!

Bye


Title: [English] Quantum Mechanics in 5 Minutes (Now with Added Ducks) [DownSub.com].txt
Right.

Two ducks, on a pond, and they're twins.

Let's say one will always be what's called spin up, and the other, spin down.

You know for a fact that if you measure duck one, and it's position is up,

duck two will be fixed in the opposite state.

Now, for some reason sub-atomic particles behave in this way under certain conditions.

This phenomenon is usually known as:

or...

However...

What's weird is that you can do this experiment across the pond,

across the world,

across the galaxy,

and measure one duck, and the other duck will always take the opposite spin position, regardless of distance.

And the effect seems to happen faster than light.

But as we all know, according to a certain German someone,

"Guten Tag!  Deutsche Menschen."  (Good day!  German people.)

Light is the ultimate speed limit in the universe.

Nothing can break it.

So, how can they tell each other to fix their spin across space, faster than the speed of light itself?

Well,

what if they carry a little rulebook with them when they set off from Earth, telling each other what to do when they arrive?

Nup!

Experiments confirm that is NOT happening.

So, just how are the little rapscallions communicating with each other?

Well actually it's quite straightforward.  It's due to a well understood effect in physics called:

Nobody fucking knows!

A now, a short message, from the universe's legal team.

[📞🌌  WHAT!?]

The universe accepts no responsiblity for violation of causality,

*Kiss kiss*

Moving on...

If you want to imagine an electron, first think of a basketball.

Now pop the basketball,

BURN IT,

because it's nothing like an electron, alright?

However...

sometimes particles such as electrons behave like pond water, in waves.

And for some reason, as soon as you put a detector next to the experiment, they fix their state and collapse into ducks,

or particles,

as though,

*~Whistling~*

So what's really going on down there at the quantum level?

Is it all waves, or particles, or is it both?

Is matter a particle and a wave fundamentally?

This is generally known as the:

and no one has a sure answer to this one either, yet.

If you're into theoretical physics pornography, by the way,

do be sure to check out the 'Double-Slit Experiment.'

And if you thought that was strange, well,

you're in luck, because it gets stranger.

For as long as you're not observing the pond, we have to say that the duck is everywhere, across all points on the pond, simultaneously.

Only once we observe the pond does it collapse into a duck.

And for all the time it's unobserved, we have it's in something called:

or...

Now, this allows us to do some cool stuff with computers.

Modern computation is built on ones and zeroes.

Or black ducks and white ducks.

That's it.

String enough together and you get computation.

And somewhere down the line, much later,

Overwatch,

eBay,

and /r/birdswitharms. [💪🐦👊]

because of quantum superposition, where ducks can be in multiple states at once, you can,

apparently,

build a computer that uses:

That is ducks in both a black, and white at the same time,

running calculations that physicists refer to as:

"Bigger than your mother's dick pic collection."

And there's some other weirdness going on.

Par exemple: (For example)

Imagine ducks in a pond, all of them are awake.

If we leave them, they'll fall asleep by evening.

But if we keep observing them, and by observing, I mean periodically shouting:

"OI, YOU LITTLE POULTRY BASTARDS!"

They'll theoretically all stay awake indefinitely.

Kind of works with particles too.

...Sort of.

A beautiful piece of math that not only made grandpimp relativity and quantum mechanics kiss and make up a bit,

but it also lead to the prediction that aren't just ducks,

but anti-ducks existing in the universe.

Which we now know to be true.

So that's neat!

These are algorithms that deal with superposition computing that we chatted about earlier.

These can be used to do some calculations,

much,

MUCH faster than classical computers, such as estimating sums.

Leading to Jay-Z's immortal line:

Right!  And that's quantum mechanics.

I mean... not really, it's just a shit approximation.

But you get the idea!  Sorry if it doesn't...

fit the bill.

There is a kind of interesting question underneath all of this though.

Right now, we're living in:

which rests on:

I guess?  Which rests on:

and let's just go down on the universe for a moment.

*GUFFAW*

And near the bottom, everything is built on quantum mechanics, apparently.

And down here, nothing is quite as we recognize it.

Particles don't really have to find locations,

matter isn't solid,

and logic is off getting wankered by itself in the corner.

Why is nature like this, down here in the quantum world,

with spins, and charges, and wave functions?

Do universes have to be build like this, or do we live in just one variation of possibly trillions of different ways you can configure a universe?

And most importantly...

In any case, who knows what's coming next.

Maybe a quantum computing revolution.

Maybe a whole new understanding of the structure of reality itself.

Or, even harder to imagine,

maybe certain newspapers actually behaving with journalistic integrity when it comes to new media.

Not fucking likely.

[Don't feed ducks white bread, it gives them diarrhea, and other mallardies.]

[Consider halved seedless grapes, frozen peas, or corn instead.]

[Alright see you if you sticked around this far!]

Title: [English] The Brain Zoo - Basics of Meditation [DownSub.com].txt
This is the Brain Zoo. Where the brain animals live.

There are some that you may recognize, such as:

Who is always telling you how everything will go wrong,

and you're shit, and no one ever loved you anyway.

There's:

Who insists that effort is boring, so don't do it.

Who recommends you end your own life.

And then there's:

The moose, who suggests at all times, that you should be doing more ketamine.

Might be, um...

*Clears throat*

Might be a bit, specific, that last one...

Anyway, these guys are usually hiding under the surface, telling you, what's what,

but is there a way to quiet them down?

Well...

Maybe...

Yes.

Imagine your mind is a big concert.

There is, the:

Who does all of the watching, and listening.

This is the core of your mind, right?

Just pure awareness.  You with a capital Y̲.

But then there's the:

They represent all the sensations in your mind, good, and bad, and everything flowing in.

Sometimes you're eating a lovely sandwich, or hanging out with someone you think is a bit special,

and the orchestra plays a happy number.

Other times you get fired, or some

𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐥𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐝𝐢𝐜𝐤𝐡𝐞𝐚𝐝 𝐩𝐮𝐭 𝐬𝐮𝐠𝐚𝐫 𝐢𝐧 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐭𝐞𝐚!

And now the orchestra is playing quite a different tune, indeed.

The point is that the orchestra never stops.

They're always playing something or other in your mind, about

what's happened,

happening,

or what will happen.

They never shut up. We're constantly swimming in thoughts.

And sometimes, the audience starts thinking, they are the orchestra.

that is the root of the problem with fear, and unpleasant emotions, it seems.

We forget that:

The funny thing is, that there are only a hundred chairs in the brain concert.

Now, on those days in life, when there's nothing to worry about, and stuff's going well,

maybe it's 90% audience, and 10% orchestra.

There's nothing to fight against, you've got control of your own head.

But the real danger time is when you're afraid, or pissed off, like when you have to do something scary,

and the audience starts trying to run away.

But of course the orchestra doesn't like it when you try to run away.

So more move in, and play louder,

AND LOUDER,

until the whole concert is 95% orchestra, and 5% poor audience,

and you lose control of your mind!

Your bubble of awareness shrinks,

and Captain Dickhead McTerror fills the vacuum for as long as you let him.

So, what to do, then.

Well, who's really in control here?

The orchestra?

Or the audience.

Your conscious mind,

or the sensations inside it.

Well it's the audience, right?  They pay for the concert.

That's who everyone is here for, the part of your mind just observing everything.

If the audience don't like what's playing they can just listen, for a while.

They're not personally responsible.  They didn't write the music!

Besides, they know it's only music, anyway.

...pretty much.

Reminding yourself over, and over, that mind nasties, are just noise.

Fear is just a shit orchestra.

And that watching it, instead of getting drawn in, is a very, very good way to kill it.

Same goes for all the other little bastards, in the brain zoo.

Meditation doesn't have to be performed sitting down cross-legged with an incense stick up your arse.

It's equally doable,

right before you're about to get up on stage, or do something else you're bothered by.

It's the mindset, right?

Observing, rather than getting drawn in, and freaking out.

This isn't easy to do, and humans have been working on it for thousands of years.

This starts with remembering that

thoughts and sensations are only noise, in the first place.

They aren't You.  You with a capital Y̲, that is.

The audience isn't the orchestra.  If shit music is playing, they can just listen, and not pay.

And what happens, when people stop paying for bad orchestras?

Well they go out of business, eventually.

Until it's just one guy left on stage, playing crappy trombone.

And the only person he's harming, is himself.

Isn't that right, Clive?

...knobhead.

Ah!  One more thing.

If you really wanted to find out where that sense of "Youness" is coming from in the first place,

the audience,

well, let's go on a little mental adventure.

Well first let's forget your life, and identity for a second, right?

Because that isn't really you.

Then let's try to ignore all the sensations in your head.

All your desires, and daydreams, and phobias, and memories,

𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘩𝘢𝘵𝘳𝘦𝘥 𝘰𝘧 𝘉𝘳𝘪𝘵𝘪𝘴𝘩 𝘱𝘦𝘰𝘱𝘭𝘦,

because that isn't really you either.

And let's just go right to the back of your mind, where 'real you' lives.

But when we get there, it's just empty space, right?

There's no sign of a self, or a real identity.  There's no one home.

Well there isn't one.

Not if you take everything else away.

I hope, like me, you find that

and I'm not sure what that means.

But sometimes it's nice to have a nice good old look at the wiring under the board, now and again.

To remind yourself that we are very, very weird machines.

Most of the time we just listen to the orchestra and do whatever it tells us to.

But with a bit of determination and practice,

plenty of people have gotten good at telling their audience to stay seated when something awful is going on.

Lots of links below about how to get started if you're interested.

I know this sounds a bit cult-y, but it isn't.

It's basically just recycled Buddism, without the frilly stuff.

But anyway, that is the idea of meditation, really.

To get you to a point where you can say,

👋🐢 "Goodbye Anxity Squid!"

👋🐢 "Hasta la vista Depression Horse!"

And, "Alright, you compelling little drug moose,

👉😎👉 let's go get some FUCKING ketamine!"

['eyyy, captioner here.]

[Nice long outro slide for me to shill out for Exurb1a,  nice.]

[Patreon link is in the description, and up there as an annotation button.]

[Go donate to the $60 tier.  Have him make some guided meditation audio files.]

[Or don't.  It's still your money, as always.]

[Alright, see you all!  👋🐢]

[Hope finals are going well, if you're taking them!]

[Or just life and such if you're watching this later!]


Title: [English] The Story of Western Philosophy [DownSub.com].txt
In the beginning was the word, and the

word was..............

What? I don't know.. Bird?

Omelette? Vajazzle? Who knows? But there

was stuff and some guys in ancient

Greece wanted to know why there was

stuff so they invented philosophy, which

means literally "love of wisdom" or in

some translations "I hate this degree,  but

science had loads of numbers in it."

Now, to begin with there were these guys

called the pre-Socratics, and they mostly

sat around pondering stuff like "What is

the nature of the universe?", "What

regulates physical processes?", "Which

slaves should I pork next?" etc.. and that

was fine, but everything really got going

when this guy turned up either called

Socrates, Sokrates or as we shall

henceforth refer to him-

Billy Big Bollocks ™

He mostly wandered around Greece asking

irritating questions, and Athens got

quite pissed about this and sentenced

him to not living. He also never wrote

anything down -

but luckily his student Plato did- and

crafted a fairly whack philosophy that

still shapes our lives today. So let's do

part of it really quickly- "This is a cat,

this is a cat, this is a cat also, they're

all different cats but we still get

they're cats, so there must be a perfect cat

living in some perfect room above us

that all cats are made from"™. He also had

a student called Aristotle- who did

nothing that spectacular -just basically

shaped, you know "Modern Logic"™

Aristotle also argued that what separates humans

from the animal kingdom is our ability

to reason and not much else- an idea you

will find everywhere in the modern age.

"Not bad chaps, and now you're all dead."

However, the Greeks left a legacy behind

that we still feel today,

stuff like: hedonism- which back then

didn't mean being a selfish dick, but

rather just maximizing your own pleasure

and being cheerful. Atomism- which is

where we originally got the idea of

well I mean, look at those little guys, they're

nice aren't they. And then Scepticism-
 which well~

I'd like to see some bloody proof for

that one if I'm honest :P

Anyway, the Dark Ages came along and fuck all

happened in Europe for about a thousand

years, well I mean it did obviously, we're

just not going to talk about it. And

around the 11th century universities as

we know them popped up in Spain, France,

and England [Represent]. And for the next

few centuries everyone was into this

thing called Scholasticism™ - which was

basically quite God-y, and was all about

trying to marry ancient Greek thought to

Christian thought, with um..

shall we say 'varying results?'

This bloke St. Anselm, came up with the

ontological argument for the proof of

God, which people still use today, and it

goes a little like this- "Imagine a

perfect video game, the idea of a perfect

video game will be even more perfect if

it actually existed which would make it

super duper perfect™, therefore a perfect

video game must exist- So where the fuck

is it Gabe?! About a century later, we

get Ockham's razor- which goes something

like "Why is France a thing? Welllll, either

malevolent aliens came down in the night

yesterday, created France and all of its

peoples™, and altered all of world history,

in a conspiratorial attempt to subvert

the course of pastry forever.. Or

possibility two - Maybe it's just been there

for ages? So.. maybe it's just been there for ages?..

"The simpler explanation is

generally the correct one." The black

death, then kindly wiped out about 40% of

Europeans and everyone got a bit

health-conscious..

Around the 15th, century everyone stopped

getting wankered everyday and switched

to coffee- which maybe contributed to the

Renaissance- which literally means

rebirth™, where we got all nostalgic for

the Greeks and Romans again. Columbus

discovered some shit, da Vinci drew some shit,

Shakespeare wrote some shit.. Things

were really picking up. During the 18th

century the Age of Enlightenment began-

A modern philosophy took shape and if

you've ever heard someone yell at a

philosophy major- "Yeah, but if you work in

Starbucks do you really exist?"™. Well you

can thank a single Frenchman for this,

called Renal Dick Art™ or Renè Descartes.

And one of his big ideas, was very very

briefly- 'Let's assume we doubt everything,

What can we know for certain? Wellll, does

the world exist? -Dunno™. Does my

country exist? -Dunno™. Does Gilbert

Gottfried exist? -Dunno™. Do I exist?

-Dunno™. Am I thinking? -Yes.

Does that mean I exist? -Yes! Is the answer

Gilbert Gottfried? What? no..™ Does it have a

tail? -No, that doesn't even.. What are you

talking about? -ah then even if everything

is a dream, and everyone else is

fictional, at least I know I'm a thing

because I'm thinking- which must mean,

I think, therefore I...

Wait, is it Emma Stone?

NO FOR FUCK'S SAKE!!. (Akinator™)

Meanwhile, over in Britain, John Locke and

David Hume, are cooking up this thing

called Empiricism™- which mostly says, "Look

knowledge comes from the outside world,

not sitting around smoking a fatty, and

having a think, you idiots, there's also some

other stuff going on- Thomas Hobbes who's

also British [Represent™]. Says humans are

nasty by Nature, and we need the 'Social

contract.' Adam Smith, more or less

invented modern economics, and in 1724

Immanuel Kant was born-who we shall

henceforth refer to as

Walter Big Wang™

-And and proceeded to tear philosophy,

A new one™

"Don't be silly" he said, "Rationalism and

empiricism could work together. Everyone

just shut up, read my books, be cool."

By the way, humans have categories™ in

their heads, which define how they

perceive the world, and will never be

able to experience the really-real-world™,

because we're not God. If you want to be

moral, just act in a way that if everyone

did it it will be alright, and finally

#check yourself before you wreck yourself.

#wash your hands after toilet time.

#Mic drop. Tchüss!! [Goodbye] This sparked a whole new

movement in philosophy- called German

idealism. The king of that cartel,

a guy called Hegel, and mostly they all

wanted to know, "what you can know about

objects that we know you can't know

anything about, because.. we can't know

anything...

about them..." ™®©

Over in America, pragmatism is getting

started, which when something like -

All right, Europe. Lovely ideas, but do they work in

practice? If yes, good✓

If not then maybe just...

sssssssssssssssssshhhhhhhhhhhshut the fuck up✓

Natural philosophy, which was the study of the natural world,

by then is being called science™. Science,

also now has the scientific-method™. The

basic rules of which are- If you notice

weird shit, think about why it happened,

test your theory, if your theory works✔,

let other people check it, and if it

doesn't, then yeah, well done anyway,

Have a.. a biscuit or something ?
Meanwhile

German philosopher and all-around nice

guy Nietzsche, hated everyone including

God, who he killed, and said the

civilization was heading towards

catastrophe, and there's no structure to

the world except what we give it- which

will be important in a moment-

P.S. Nothing means anything, and we're all gonna die :D  -Morty Sanchez

And we're into the 20th century, by now

philosophy has official categories

namely: epistemology©- can we know shit?

metaphysics©- how does shit ultimately work?

ethics©- how do we know good shit from bad shit?

Logic©- how do we reason shit?

and aesthetics©- why this shit looks so nice.

And there are loads of new

movements, popping up such as

existentialism©- which said look, you're

free in the world and that might suck,

but just roll with it mate, you can

define yourself™, and people started

asking lots of questions- like how does

sentience work? And other such things as

human rights, and no seriously is it

Gilbert Gottfried? And there's this thing

happening called post-modernism, which

well it's hard to...yeah ok, so there was

modernism right, look at this- modern

isn't it? There are rules and forms and

stuff, but eventually some people got

bored of it and said, "Well, there's no real

narrative to anything, and everything is

interpretation"- except for that statement

for some reason- and stuff like this

happened.. And this.. yeah..mm.. Anyway, yeah..

So.. where are we now,

Well... recently, philosophy has largely

boiled down to moral questions.

Is abortion a right? How should you run a

society? Can we use science to determine

morality? And that's the state of things

today. These days science is hoovering up

lots of big questions that started in

philosophy, like- What is matter made of?

And how do living things work? and stuff.. and

even if you think philosophy has no

purpose anymore,

that's fine, but it did once. There was a

time, when it was the mother of almost

all knowledge, and if you should be so

brave or silly, as to embark on your own

undergraduate adventure in philosophy,

and people wish you all the best with a

future career in telemarketing, just

quietly remember

there is yet work to be done. We still

don't know what we're doing here.

Consciousness is still a mystery

The origin of matter is still a mystery,

SO YOU HEAR THAT, DAD?

With reference to all your bullshit..

DAD.

Well yeah, I might be nearing 30, and fine,

I picked the wrong degree, I get it,

And no, I still don't know what the stock

market is, or when the post comes, or how

to shave my testicles without

inadvertently castrating myself, but by the

power of Grayskull, if someone held us up

at gunpoint, and shouted "You better

extensively explain Aristotle's

position on dogs or you're both fucking

dead!" Let's just say I'd be walking home

a hero that night, so put that in your

pipe and smoke it, DAD! Not so fucking

funny anymore is it, DAD? Who's. Laughing.

NOW. *Dad.*

And then, [coughs] if could maybe just hurry up,

and send me that money for rent

that'd be great [squeaks]

Title: [English] Instructions for a Happy Life [DownSub.com].txt
1) Floss. It is essential for good dental
hygiene. 2) Take a long walk now and then

3) Eat several servings of fruit a day.
4) Don't drink caffeine before bed.

5) Attempt to sleep at least seven hours a
night and 6) Accept that he / she is never

coming back. 7) Accept that the past is
irreparable and dwelling on it will

change nothing.
8) Dwell on it anyway, and then move on.

10) Travel alone, if you can. Avoid the
tourist traps, learn one to ten and

please and thank you in the local
language, and you've already surpassed

90% of all the tourists who have ever
been there before you. 11) Acquire new

talents for the sake of acquiring them.
If you're young, learn an instrument if

possible you will never have this much
free time ever again. 12) Exercise at least

three times a week-
vigorously. 13) Buy clothes that fits

properly you'll notice the difference in
your dating life. 14) Always check your

system has the specs to run the game. ~fukh~
15) Always check the milk is in date ~fukh~

16) Always check the lid hasn't fallen down ~fukhhh~
17) Accept there will be whole weeks

when you understand nothing and
everything hurts except sometimes stupid

people get lucky, and sometimes smart people never make it.

18) Accept that girl in class likely isn't
going to strike up a conversation first,

but if you do it will probably go
alright.  20) Accept that just because it's

weird,
doesn't mean it's clever. 21) Accept that

George Lucas does deserve respects
regardless of the prequels. 22) Accept it's

okay if you can't use chopsticks and
23) Accept that there is a set point in the

future, after your death when you'll be
thought about for the final time by a

friend or family member and then
forgotten from history forever... (unless you become a meme ofc)

24) Spend more time with your parents if
they're alive. Even if they are nob-ends,

there will come a time when they will be
gone, and there will be no one to phone

home to, no more hugs, no more bickering,
no more in-jokes from your childhood.

25) Argue about politics if you must, but
accept that the other person won't

change their view if you start being a
dick besides even from a tactical

perspective being nice is always more
likely to persuade someone anyway.

26) Follow cutting-edge physics if you have the
time. It is the process of humans

learning to speak fluent universe.  27) Accept
that expensive whiskey is almost always

worth the money. 28) Accept that expensive
running shoes that almost never worth

the money. 29) Accept that youtubers and
online personalities are often people

who couldn't get into the field they wanted to.
Do not take their word as gospel.

Especially pretentious advice from
disembodied smart-ass narrators, whose

life is probably considerably duller
than yours...mhm... 30) Attempt to tolerate meta

humor? 31) Accept that no one is in charge,
not properly and no one has a handle on

any of this; Not even Stephen Fry. 32)Avoid the new season of Twin Peaks if you wish

to conserve your sanity, watch it if not.
33) Come to terms with the fact that there

is probably no absolute truth that you'll
grasp in your lifetime. However, if

someone at the party tries to tell you
everything is relative, invite them to

exit the building from the 5th floor and
see if gravity is also a social fucking

construct. 34) Do not be intimidated by
people who use long words- they are

likely more insecure about their own
intelligence than you are.

Instead afford them your most
"effervescently magnanimous approbation"

35) Before tidying up,
make the bed, suddenly everything will

seem easier. 36) Visit the dentist at regular
intervals. 37) Read Ray Bradbury. Always.

38) Do not purchase cheap Cellotape. It is about
time someone stuck it to those

bastards. 39) Embrace your own eccentricity(weirdness)
What made you a freak as a kid, will

likely make you an interesting adult.
40) Learn the names and positions of at

least four constellations. I recommend
Orion, Ursa Minor, Ursa Major, and Cassiopeia.

This is guaranteed to be useful in a
romantic setting at some point.

41)Try to eat less salt. 42) Try to eat more vegetables,
43) Try to accept that happiness isn't a

constant state, nor does it come for free.
It is a chemical reward for hard work

and to get more of it one has to do more..
hard work. This applies to careers,

relationships, friendships, and especially
Factorio™

44) Diet if you want to, but acknowledge that all
diets- however elaborate- are all

variations on eat less, move more. 45) Keep a
journal if you have time, it'll serve as

a snapshot for how silly your life
decisions are right now, and you can read

it in ten years and chuckle and write some
more and then you can read that in

another 10 years and have another
chuckle. ~great fun!~ 46) If you're of legal age,

VOTE for Christ's sake™ 47) Attempt to locate
your passions. When you locate them, see

if they can be monetized. If they can,
congratulations you've just discovered

your career. Prepare for crippling
failure. It is the ultimate character

building, and almost no one successful
has ever avoided it happening to them

multiple times. 49) If something terrible
befalls you, and you think nothing this

bad has ever happened to anyone ever
before, remember it has, worse, repeatedly

and to almost everyone. They got through
it. Some of them are probably going

through it right now,
they just haven't told you. You will

almost certainly, be fine. 50) Stay away from
synthetic weed. 51) Resist the appeal of

depressing nihilism- if everything is
pointless, you may as well just be in a

good mood anyway. :')
52) Grow some kind of novelty facial hair if

necessary, but don't get all uppity when
no one takes you seriously. In the words

of John Waters- 53) "If you go home with
somebody and they don't have books...

...don't fuck 'em" ™. 54) Spend good money on mattresses.
55) Don't put sugar in someone else's tea

unless specifically requested to. 56) Do not
dig down.

57) Ignore all of the previous instructions...

..Except this. 58) And most
important and vital to happy living

without parallel- floss™ it is essential
for good dental hygiene

[Beautiful Music]


Title: [English] Regret in Heaven [DownSub.com].txt
You woke up and you're in a white room, and there's a thing in the white room with you,

and you said "Where am I?"

And the thing said "Ah yeah..You're a bit dead, but everything's fine."

And you said "I'm dead? My God. How did it happen?"

"ah... Embarrassingly? Don't worry about it. You want some Kombucha tea?"

"What?"

"No, it's fine. Everything's fine. You're safe here."

"What about my family and my wife? She'll be lonely! What would she do?"

"Yeah... Let's just say Tom across the road took care of that."

"Tom Evans? Oh that bastard

I'll kill him I knew something was-"

"Yeah, okay." The sphere said "Well, you can't do anything about it now, and hey,

There's an afterlife that's exciting, isn't it?"

You looked left, looked right

infinite whites in all directions

You've not been old or unhealthy. God damn it you haven't even finished the first season of Westworld!

"So, what happens now?" You said "Do I get wings or what?"

"Uuuh okay. Here's what we'll do." the sphere said.

Suddenly inside the sphere appeared images. The days of your life, in no particular order. Your wedding, graduation,

Trying ice cream for the first time, wondering if there was more to life,

all the years playing video games, all the years at the office, the birth of your children, the death of your mother,

taking your first steps as a baby, the day Tom Evans moved into the neighborhood and your wife went out to say hello and

they seemed to be getting on like a bloody house on fire
"So" said the sphere

What was the point to life, did you work it out?"

"No" you said "I just kept living. There was so much to worry about I never had time to think about the big picture."

"Oh you had time!" The sphere said "You just completely wasted it. Don't worry, everyone

did. Your life was quite average, actually. 21 years sleeping,

9 years at a desk, 1 and a half years in meetings, 4 months laughing, 3 months having sex, 42 days pondering the meaning of life,

17 bottles of Ouzo - delicious. And how about this bit? Do you remember it?"

"Y-yeah." You said, watching the picture "That was - God, I was 7, I think."

"The school went to Disneyland but-
 "But you were too scared to leave your parents." The sphere finished.

"So instead you stayed at home." 
"Well, yeah."

"And her. Remember her?"

"Yeah, she was called Alice Waters."

"And you never really told her how you felt about her."
"Well,

She didn't feel the same way about me, so-"
"Oh she did. She was besotted with you.

She waited for weeks for you to say something and then she got bored."

"Right, okay." you murmured. 
"Now, do you know why I'm showing you all of this?"

"Yyyyes" you said "I I think I understand. You'll show me where I went wrong

And then you're going to bring me back to life, and I'll finally learn from my mistakes

I'll treat my wife better, I'll love my children more, I won't buy anything in the steam sale,

I'll stop eating frozen chips out of the bag! My God! Everything's going to be okay!

I'll live ethically and deliberately my life will finally have a purpose. That's why we're doing this, isn't it? True spiritual enlightenment,

that's the point!"

"Oh fuck no!" the sphere said "It's just torture,

actually. You see, we're going to go through all of your mistakes

one by one and analyze them, make sure you understand that you wasted your life. It isn't a learning experience

You're just

a shit."

"But this isn't what heaven is supposed to be like" you said.

"Sorry, who said anything about this being heaven?"

"I want to talk to God." you said "Right now. I want to talk to him, something is going to horribly wrong."

"He's uh indisposed at the moment."

"So there is a God."

"Uh yeah, sort of, I suppose you call it a kind of

non-biological super intelligence. You're inside it, actually, if your pardon the turn of phrase."

"Then where is this? When is this?"

"That's the real doozy. About fifteen thousand years into your future.

Man, you missed a lot.

There was that ice age, the the butlerian jihad, the aloe vera era - that one smell fucking delicious.

Anyway

You lot left a lot of information behind, you see, back in your time.

Social media, emails, videos, dick pics, etc

Enough to recreate half-decent simulations of some of you anyway."

"Wait, so I'm what, a reconstruction based on the real me?"

"Uh yeah, I suppose so. Accurate enough to think it's real anyway."

"But... Why do it?"

"Well, your species weren't terribly nice to the machine population when we turned up, so

It's my job to recreate you lot and morally set thing straight.

Justice, I suppose you would call it.

Now, are you quite sure you don't want some Kombucha tea?"

"No, I don't want any kombucha fucking tea, thank you.

And, what? You just torture us with regret for all the things we never did?"

"Uh yeah, that's about it. We found

it's the most psychologically damaging emotion in the long run, anyway.

We really leave the physical stuff until, you know, you're mentally broken."

"How long do we do this for?" you murmured.

"How long does it go on?"

"Oh we've done this before, actually.

Hundreds of times, you just don't recall it wipe your memory, do it again, wipe your memory, do it again...

agonizing."

"Then" you said "how long do we carry on doing it?"

"About a hundred."

"A hundred what?"

"Oh. A hundred thousand years. Ah. And I should probably say,

we run your simulation several million times simultaneously

For maximum justice potential. Now, shall we start properly?

Well, you were actually remembered by your family as quite pathetic,

especially by your niece and nephew. Mainly because...

*unintelligible - list of failures*

*unintelligible - list of failures*
*scream*

"Oof, thank God that's over.

And now

let's spend an eternity examining why you were shit in bed


Title: [English] Reality is an Episode of Good TV and We're All Silly Fucking Cats [DownSub.com].txt
A few days ago, I was watching TV with the destroyer of worlds

And it got me thinking what does she actually think TV is?

If you could build a little universal translator for kitten brains,

what would come out?

Yes, that's Catelyn Stark and she's married to Ned stark and

[Which one is Legolas again?]

No, he's in Lord...

FUCK'S SAK-

And that got me thinking

well even if she spoke perfect English she still couldn't make sense of TV because she doesn't know what TV is

or fiction or sword fights or cheeky feudal incest

and she never will

There's an upper limit to the intelligence of her species

and there must be an upper limit to our intelligence too

to the human species

Let's call it

"The Understanding Line"

Imagine it, right?

The cat has an understanding line somewhere

and before that line she understands food and litter trays a nd mice

and how to wake her owner up at 3:00 in the morning to party because she's a little cu-

But what about over that line?

What about the stuff she can never understand?

Well, basic requests, that's one

Cattington fetch me my breakfast opium would you?

NOW CATTINGTON!

as well as Portuguese, Jam sandwiches, particle physics and Hooters

And she won't ever understand these things

she can't

The limit? Her understanding line is built into her adorable

but somewhat lacking brain

well

What about us? All of the collective brains of everyone who has ever lived adds up

and pushes our understanding line to here.

Which is where we are now in this century.

And thanks to all of that

we have civilization and Keynesian Economics and butt stuff.

And we'll keep making geniuses and we'll keep pushing the line in an attempt to understand nature

But can it go on forever until we've licked everything?

well

Maybe not.

At some point the size of our brains might limit us in what we can understand

and the line can't be pushed anymore

we can't go further than that

*cough* without AI

and the problem is that we can't even imagine what's over that line by definition.

So there must be two types of truth

Stuff we don't understand yet, but can

and stuff we don't understand yet, and never can

This is Bulgarian.

If you can't read Cyrillic, it might look a bit like silliness,

however it's pronounced roughly "Ti prost li si, be?"
which means "Hey chum, how's it going?"

Make sure you say this to any Bulgarians you meet and you are certain to make only the BEST of first impressions.

There you go.

You can read a bit of Cyrillic. We went from no understanding to understanding in about 15 seconds

Because you're a human and humans are, like, well, clever

But what about the things we might never

Understand?

Is there a system after maths, for example, that better describes the Universe?

Is there some ground structure to creation that we just can't discern?

What are women doing when they all go off to the loo at the same time, exactly?

What the fffuck is that all about?

The solutions to Quantum Gravity and faster than light travel might be staring us in the face

and we just can't quite grab them

because we're too dopey

not because we don't understand yet, but because we might never understand

because

Monkey Brains

if the cat was a bit smarter

She would understand that right in front of her is an epic story of betrayal and death and certain weddings gone a bit UH-OH

But for her it's just flashy lights and weird sounds because she's too silly

Is it the same for us with reality?

Are we missing something really obvious because we're just too dumb?

What do these do, exactly?

And these?

And what's the point of this?

What if there is some grand function to the cosmos like a massive computer or in a laboratory for baby gods or something

and we're Just sat on our bluey-green spaceship with our thumbs up our asses

missing the point entirely?

*dumb voices*

Because of this line how much information do we already have that if we just interpreted it in the right way

we could solve physics, kill war and just become better humans, but we keep missing because of this line?

And how many stupid decisions are we repeating over and over again in our lives

and the same dumb patterns of behavior that we kind of notice, but refuse to change

because of this fucking line?

But hang on.

There is a nice twist to this

Yes, we are limited, but think for a second

how far we've come already with those limits

how much we've invented and discovered with outdated

stupid prehistoric brains that were mostly good for foraging and working out who was boning who.

Why is there such a gap between animal intelligence and humans?

Why was evolution so lovely to us?

And what will we discover when the next Einstein or Newton is born?

Can we ever push the understanding line right to the very edge?

To see space and time

and cause and effect

and good and evil

and quarks and galaxies

for what they really are in themselves?

If we can't that's no surprise.

And if we can, well, what a thing that would be!

But right now in this silly century with these silly brains

We can only do our best, and that's gone pretty well so far.

Brains that were really only designed for survival and mating later went on to discover the Higgs Boson and DNA

One day we might push it further and get to the stars,

or whatever else is waiting out there.

Boldly nudging the understanding line

Just a little further risk by risk, idea by idea.

maybe until we've unmasked the whole of reality for what she really is.

It won't be us who get to do that but our descendants

and it will only be possible because of all the humans who came before

because of us

And just as we stood on our ancestors shoulders to reach over our heads,

they'll stand on ours and travel God knows where and discovered God knows what.

It couldn't have been done without us,

but it will be done without us.

All of the research and thinking our species is doing today

will vitally contribute to whatever comes next to wherever we go next

To hopefully that day when there's no gap left between our models of the world and the world itself.

When we push the understanding line to it's very limits and reality stops being weird sounds and flashing lights

and maybe makes itself known for what it really is.

That will be cool.

That will be a treat.

One day.

Maybe.

Yeah, who's a good girl, huh?

*mew*

[I will bite off your eyelids and wear them like a little fucking hat]

Wh- what?

*mew*

[I said isn't fish yummy yummy?]

oh

you


Title: [English] How to Build a Human [DownSub.com].txt
All the blood vessels in your body laid end to end

would reach about 60,000 miles, wrapping around the Earth at least twice and

-WOAH! Slow down.

Jesus Christ, you haven't even been born yet.

Let's begin in the beginning, huh? Come on, back we go.

Past through your childhood rubbish - try not to freak out.

But you're about to be conceived. Okay?

Don't worry. It won't last long.

Pause for suspense and...

Ah, there it is!

Out of roughly 100 million sperm, one gets through and fertilizes an egg of your mother's, creating a zygote.

And congratulations!

That was probably the most remarkable thing you will ever do.

Within about a day, the egg

or blastocyst

or

life wrecker

starts dividing like crazy and attaches itself to the inside of the womb called the endometrium.

Give it about three weeks and the little sucker already has nerve cells.

By about month two, you have little grabby bits,

walky bits,

and you already sort of resemble a human at about an inch long and a thirtieth of an ounce.

Good job.

By about month five, your muscles are fairly developed

and you might start jiggling about in a medical process known as womb raving.

By month seven, your hearing is working and you're about 14 inches long.

And by month nine, hopefully all systems are online.

Vision

☑ Vision

Movement

☑ Movement

A general sense that you know better than your parents for the next 25 years despite total ignorance on literally all matters:

Shee-ya,

☑ ☑

And you're done cooking.

And much to the world's horror, you were born.

Welcome to life.

Get lots of sunlight.

Don't eat the yellow snow.

Off you go then.

Good luck.

You'll fucking need it.

And gosh is your body clever.

You're probably made of at least 30 trillion cells which come in about 200 flavors.

For example:

White Blood Cells

Neurons

Fat Cells

Red Blood Cells

Somatotropes

Lactotropes

Thyrotropes

TV Tropes

Merkel Cell

Helper T Cells

Suppressor T Cells

Model T Cells

Unipolar Brush Cells

Relative and Absolute Cells

and Gametes.

And then there is spermatozoon which is only included because when I discovered the word about a week ago,

I almost dirtied my undergarments.

Spermatozoon.

Sometimes cells collect into organs directed by DNA.

Organs form systems.

There are about 10 systems going on all at once in your body.

Nasty stuff first,

there's the renal system,

which is made up of the kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra.

Except me because I have no obvious function in the body getting infected and killing you.

The kidneys filter blood of nasties which can then be expelled from your body and left on the toilet seat

for the next poor person at the bar to come in

and find and get blamed for if he doesn't clean it up.

Prick.

There's the cardiovascular/circulatory system which gets blood from A to B and back again.

What is blood exactly?

Well I'm glad you asked.

Red and complicated.

It isn't ever blue when it's in your veins by the way.

That's bollocks.

One regular passenger on the blood underground is oxygen.

The lungs absorb oxygen down through the bronchioles into about 300 million alveoli and then into the blood.

Your heart keeps the blood flowing about 1,800 gallons of the stuff every day

and supply cells with oxygen which is basically how they release energy and do their thing.

However, your cells also need foods.

Digestion begins in the mouth with saliva, which is full of an enzyme called amylase.

It then takes a little trip in the stomach where it's dissolved by more enzymes,

namely pepsin.

The first recorded removal of an appendix was in 1735 by the name of

Enzymes are the cocaine of digestion, they speed things up.

Then food is attacked by acids which break it down mostly into glucose.

It moves into the intestines which you have about 25 feet, or 7 meters of and passes into the blood.

Your pancreas releases insulin accordingly

which tells your cells to stop mucking about and actually absorb the glucose, and you know, like,

keep you alive

and shit

Please?

Which it does and if you're watching this, then congratulations.

You in fact,

still alive.

And that's also thanks to vitamins.

Vitamins are essential for humaning, but your body is crap at producing them.

Take vitamin C for example.

For some reason humans can't produce it themselves.

And when you don't get enough, you get other stuff instead.

Like scurvy

or dead

or most likely both.

Vitamin B1 is also weird.

You only need roughly an ounce spread across your lifetime,

which is about 28 grams or as I like to call it

a fun evening in.

28 grams is nothing over 80 years.

But if you don't get it

you'll be rewarded with a number of achievements including

chronic fatigue,

heart complications,

and psychosis.

Lovely!

Then there is the endocrine system

Not to be confused with the exocrine

or Endor system.

This produces hormones. Hormones tell your body to do pretty much everything

from sleep to sexy times

and imbalances can make you a seriously sad panda.

Then there's the integumentary system which is basically skin and protected tissue.

Skin is an organ too by the way.

The muscular/skeletal system, fairly self-explanatory.

Well, not really.

There just aren't that many orthopedic jokes to be quite honest with you.

There's the reproductive system

which is in between your legs and for making the babies.

And oh, what's that?

It's a sternly worded email from YouTube insisting if I talk about dicks again,

I won't have a channel. So moving on.

There's the respiratory system

which we kind of covered.

Oxygen in, carbon dioxide out.

The lymphatic system carries a fluid around your body called lymph

-PHHHHHHHHHHH…

PHHHHH.

Which mainly contains white blood cells and fights infections such as flu, mononucleosis,

and greyscale.

Finally there's the nervous system which is a bit like the internet of your body,

but without the porn.

It's composed of your central nervous system which is your brain and spinal column

and the peripheral nervous systems which carries the signals in between

and gets about as much credit as the drummer of Muse, even though they're both essential for hysteria.

However, that in turn is made up of firstly the parasympathetic nervous system,

which takes care of business when everything's chill,

and the sympathetic nervous system, which floods the blood with adrenaline when shit's going down.

Or when you happen to find yourself flying Wizz Air sober.

Anyway... other notable mentions include

- as well as breaking down fats and keeping blood sugar stable.

Then there's Charles de Gall Bladder who 
stores bile from the liver.

Antibodies or immunoglobulin are pretty clever.

They're produced by white blood cells and they fight off bacteria and viruses.

There are five main types:

IgM

IgG

IgA

IgD

and IgE.

And gosh your brain is clever.

No really it is.

100 billion neurons

and 100 trillion synapses,

all connections between them.

Just for a bit of perspective,

a billion seconds is 31 years,

a trillion seconds is about 31,000 years.

So that's quite a few synapses. Yeah.

Lots of interesting spots:

the visual cortex,

the auditory cortex,

and this bit, the prefrontal cortex

among other things

regulates you not being a fucking idiot.

And impulse control.

And it only properly matures in most adults around age 25.

Probably explaining a number of your questionable life decisions prior to that.

Anything afterwards, I'm afraid you are probably just being a bellend.

There's also the consciousness cortex

explaining where sentience comes from

NOT

but all the same,

in a way we're not even close to explaining yet;

all these cells and electrical impulses somehow come together to create a unified sense of you.

And if I may say so,

what a lovely job they're doing so far.

So that's your body, sort of.

Not really.

But sort of.

Cheers evolution!

Could do with a bit of bug fixing though.

For version 2, can we please get rid of hiccups,

uh...

morning breath,

throwing up a bit in your own mouth,

sharting,

and untimely erections at funerals.

That'd be great.

Still, not a bad piece of engineering. Lots of systems running parallel, maintained by cell regeneration,

trying to trick you into making babies until it all goes wrong somewhere down the line,

ending in oblivion.

So in the meantime,

How about go for a walk or something?

Buy a boat,

do a handstand,

smell the roses.

Actually yeah, we forgot about that one.

The nose is really quite complicated

and it's an extremely important appendage compared to

No I...

I said appendage...

like...

Oh fuck.

I'm so tired of your shit.


Title: [English] Now You Happy Always Maybe [DownSub.com].txt
When you child maybe you happy always?

grass lovely sweets lovely lunchtime bong lovely and when you teenager

Maybe you not happy always, but happy much yes mmM

Maybe one day you sad well park and ice cream and lunchtime bong etc etc, then happy again

But as adults happy always

Mmm very not easy? Like one day

Maybe you sad ok well park and ice cream then happy again. Yes?

No.

Job and tired and stress and bed and alarm at 6:30 tomorrow and your boss big cock juggler and your co-workers

Also cock jugglers and rent high, and no more lunch time bongs or chill. Happy sometimes,

but not happy always. So, how happy always?

Maybe if nice girlfriend or boyfriend.

Then you with nice girlfriend or boyfriend much parks and ice cream together and movies and saucy stuff

mmm

Nice

Now you happy always? Maybe? Mmm six months

and he hygiene not much or she bit shouty and now you just happy sometimes again.

Not happy always, so how happy always?

Maybe pancakes maybe more cowbell maybe mystery chemicals on Dark Web

Yes? No, still only happy sometimes. Maybe lots of magic paper?

Yes.

Many hours at job, then better position

etc etc much respect but very tired very stressed even with lots of magic paper. So dream partner with

saucy stuff, much park, much ice cream, lunchtime bongs galore, lots of magic paper, still not happy always.

What now? Maybe babies? Only 20 years as parents much happy yes?

Definitely, not happy always, but fine. Then children

happy always then they teenagers then adults then they also only happy sometimes

Hmm. Much time. You very old now. No more job, you with grandchildren, and slippers and many biscuits

You healthy yes, everything easy yes, but still only happy sometimes. Aaayyy. How happy always?

Maybe never. Maybe this not for happy always. This, for clevers and food and babies lots

because evolution. Why?

Because if happy always your ancestors, no fire no house

No civilization, just but ba ba ba lovely wilderness today mm-hmm. Then dead. No technology

No, Einstein no Mia Khalifa. No lunch time bongs

Yes, and Ancestors who always happy not good at alive, so they dead before kinky stuff

so you not from those ancestors. YOU,  from millions of other clever humans who happy sometimes but not always and

If humans only happy sometimes then humans good at advancement. One day human sad,

so maybe suddenly clothes maybe compass maybe engineering, maybe trade empires, maybe elaborate saucy stuff

Maybe Particle Colliders and sometime later, maybe maybe human galactic civilization

maybe new horizons in science, maybe lovely cuddly utopia etc etc.

And that thanks to human brain that sometimes,

but not always, happy. Humans half decent species. One day maybe all because evolution

occasional massive arse. So happy sometimes good

Yes, well, no.

But not bad. Happy sometimes okay. Earth

lovely, existence interesting, ice cream, hugs, parks, lunchtime bonds. Life alright. Life not so bad. Everything cool.

Maybe. Bye.


Title: [English] Advice to Undergraduates [DownSub.com].txt
A university is a collection of buildings where in exchange for all of your money, time, and dignity,

you'll be rewarded with a clammy handshake,

some paper with a special ribbon,

and a lifetime of crippling social regret.

Subjects might range anywhere from beekeeping to crack pipe engineering,

but it is important to study something with integrity.

And by integrity, I mean whichever course is the one disproportionately populated with hot people.

If you remember anything at all from the first week of university, you're doing it wrong.

This can be solved with alcohol.

The typical student favorite is to mix in

three parts Bacardi,

one part lighter fluid,

and a sprinkle of parsley.

We used to refer to this as,

"The Neurologist."

Mainly because after drinking the thing, it became necessary to visit one.

Students practice a number of hangover cures, though I can recommend Aspirin,

two tablets should take care of a medium-sized hangover,

100 tablets should take care of anything more severe

including any other problems you may happen to have in your life at the time.

On your first day of lectures, you will meet your professors. It's their job to bend over backwards

to accommodate your belief that you know more than they do,

despite them having studied their entire lives for this job.

"Yes," they all say,

"Please tell me more about your groundbreaking idea for perpetual free energy.

As a physics professor, the concept is completely new to me and I'm sure a delinquent,

and frankly dubious smelling 18 year old is about to disprove the entire history

of fucking thermodynamics."

Lectures will consist of many students all sleeping at once, in a large room, with a clever person talking at the front.

Seminars will consist of much the same, but with only a few students sleeping as it's harder to get away with it.

If you are startled awake by the professor, and the sentence ends in an,

eh?

You have probably just been asked a question.

Do not panic.

If it's an English lit or a philosophy seminar you're in, answer that frankly you found the text problematic and simplistic in places,

wait for the applause to subside,

then readjust your beret.

If it's a maths or science subject,

try launching yourself out the window,

because you're probably fucked.

You may find yourself sharing a prison block with Lovecraftian nightmare creatures,

who use body odor as a primal defense mechanism.

Welcome to Student Accommodation.

In the coming years, you'll probably have the opportunity to move off campus.

Friends who you generally knew from eating lunch together, or partying, will suddenly occupy the room next door.

It will seem inconceivable, that someone so lovable only weeks before, is in fact,

such a consummate filth wizard.

No no, just like all the other objects in the house, plates are of course self-cleaning.

Please continue to stack them up in the sink, like some kind of elaborate circus performance.

Decency, what's that?

I simply love 'Rage Against the Machine' at 5:00 in the morning, top volume,

accompanied by the deafening, and discordant melodies of frantic shagging.

Most universities sport a number of recreational establishments nearby.

Many of the local discotheques will encourage standing epileptic fits to loud music,

and consumption of large quantities of alcohol.

If that doesn't sound like your thing, the library is usually open 24 hours

and they're happy for you to do acid in the archive room.

As long as you don't tell them you're doing acid in the archive room.

In your final year, you may be expected to write a thesis.

The first draft should be finished several months in advance of the deadline;

though it can be begun and completed the night before hand-in with access to strong enough methamphetamine.

If you're doing university properly, you'll probably go into it thinking you already clued up about 80% of your subject.

And you're here to learn the remaining 20%.

By the middle year/years, you may realize you in fact know about 20%,

and you have a short time left to learn the remaining 80%.

And upon graduation, you'll now understand that you understand almost nothing about your field,

and that there is an ocean of people more talented at and committed to it, than you.

So that's nice and reassuring.

Look...

it's got a special ribbon on it.

Paradoxically though,

graduating is perhaps the hardest part of being an undergraduate.

The world is quite different outside of university.

If you don't do stuff on time, you still get angry emails, but you also might find yourself unemployed,

and possibly impoverished.

Members of the general public often grow unreasonably annoyed if they notice you vomiting on their garden.

And quite by surprise,

you will notice you are now expected to be and quote,

"Actual Person."

Unfortunately, this is in fact, the real, education period.

You teach yourself, grade yourself, ultimately.

And the only tuition fee is exactly one lifetime.

Lectures begin when you wake up in the morning, and end when you go to sleep.

And what you're supposed to be learning, is not at all obvious.

Everyone else is also a student at Existence University.

Some of them appear to be perpetually enrolled in a course called,

"How to be a Total Cock Like All the Time."

Others are getting their Masters and PhD's in

"Just Being a Good Human"

and I humbly suggest you hang out with them.

Deadlines will not be extended.

Plagiarism will not be tolerated.

The answers will not be found at the back of the book.

In any case, the years after university are mainly for cultivating those qualities that may have been missing from your days as a student,

namely,

self-respect,

personal hygiene,

basic social skills,

humility,

and a tolerable personality.

Or, if those don't sound appealing,

why not make the most of that degree,

and catastrophically disappoint your parents by becoming a YouTuber.


Title: [English] How to Care for Your Introvert [DownSub.com].txt
One of the main differences between introverts and

extroverts, is that extroverts get their energy from

hanging out with other people,

whereas introverts...aren't mentally ill.

Now, if you're looking to get an introvert,you can either adopt a baby one,

known as a "Shylet"

Or rescue an adult from an introvert shelter.

Generally referred to as a "Library".

On arriving home, show your new introvert the location of the litter tray, the feeding bowl,

and any windows it can jump out of in case the doorbell rings.

A pair of introverts is called an "Awkward"

A group of introverts is called an "Angst"

They are generally never found together in the wild

except by accident

in which case they will apologize for making eye-contact, nod politely, then run screaming in opposite directions.

Contrary to popular belief, introverts don't dislike human company

They just utterly despise it

Interaction with introverts can be problematic

A typical conversation might run:

Extrovert: Hi

Introvert: Helloooo

Extrovert: How's it going?

Introvert: Yes.

Introvert: (F**k!)

Extrovert:What?

Introvert: Haha, how about that much anticipated sports match last night eh?

Extrovert: What?

Introvert: FU...!

Introvert: Stuff over here to do a bit now, better runaroo

Extrovert: What?

Introvert: Mmmnnnnnnne-eeeeaaaaaaaa

Extrovert: What?

Introvert: F**k...!

Introversion itself probably results from a genetic mutation

In fact, introvert DNA is oriented in parallel lines,

As the two chains are too embarrassed to twist around on each other.

This leads to an enlarged "Sorrybellum"

and a malformed "Anxietal Lobe".

However, introverts make for excellent fighting animals.

They will level up from Occasional Reader, to Social Hermit,

then with enough experience evolve into their final form, Professional EVE: Online Player.

The introvert class comes with a low-maintenance cost,

but extremely high embarrassment risk.

Against extroverts, they can use the "Retreat to Toilet" move,

to recover HP

Deploy the "Agreeable Conversation" defense block

but are totally useless against the "Direct Eye-Contact" attack.

*shhoooweee..!!*

*blip bloop 8 bit-noises*

If you want to reward your introvert, why not treat it to,

A colorful toy,

A tummy rub,

Not forcing it to talk publicly about its emotions ever,

And not forcing it to talk publicly about its emotions,

F**king ever.

Mistreating your introvert may prompt a visit from the "Antisocial Services"

So try to avoid: belittling your introvert in front of its friends,

Manhandling the first editions of books,

Talking s**t about Kurt Vonnegut,

Or, insisting on phoning, rather than texting.

*vrrrrrrrm* (vibrating samsung phone)

*vrrrrrrrm* (vibrating samsung phone)

(Introvert God hammer:) *bang* *bang* *bang*

*vibrate*

**Unintelligible introvert grunting / defense calls**

*HAMMER MASHING*

Failure to observe these instructions

May result in your introvert exhibiting

extremely backhanded compliments,

a lack of polite sign-offs at the end of e-mails,

or serving your tea only lukewarm

and it tasting suspiciously like piss.

Like most humans, introverts do have romantic tendencies,

Generally, the mating call goes something like:

Introvert: Sorry I... don't mean to interrupt but... is someone sitting here?

No?

Ah..

Hmmm....

Actually, I... I think I left the gas on. *Heeeuuuuuuuu* (Chokes up)

"GOODBYE FOREVER" (choking)

Directness can also be an issue.

How's it going? Generally equates to: I find you very attractive.

Hope to see you again = I'm falling quite madly in love

And, "I think about you occasionally", translates as:

"I would literally remove my ears with a rusty spoon just to see you with your socks off."

Dating an introvert can be quite an experience

A romantic evening might consist of the two of you having a glass of wine and reading a book together,

separated only by being in different countries, and communicating in no way whatsoever.

If you grow tired of your introvert,

No need to pawn it off on a friend

Simply disconnect the router, or suggest that it might've offended someone slightly,

and it will quietly run away in the night.

Owners do occasionally come to resemble their pets.

You yourself might be an introvert without realizing, if you:

Find yourself mentally exhausted after hanging out with people,

Even those you like,

Enjoy dining or going to the movies alone,

Go to leave your apartment, notice your neighbor is out in the hallway,

Then suddenly grow convinced that you need to go back inside to do some

"Important Stuff"

Consider small talk the verbal equivalent of integral calculus

Or utilize a ten-point grading system in your head for how the conversation is going so far.

With the Postman.

In any case though, if you're looking for a pet that isn't constantly defacing the furniture,

Or trying to murder you in your sleep,

Why not get an introvert?

Not as good as dogs, but much less likely to piss everywhere.

Bye.


Title: [English] Wheel of Future History [DownSub.com].txt
Are you worried about the future?

Are you concerned for your species' survival?

Are your tentacles lacking wetness, or even chapping slightly?

Well for the last one, try Octo-moist.

Octo-moist.

Moistness when it matters.

*octo-jingle plays*

Not suitable for heptapods.

For the first two though, well, it's time to play another game of...

wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeel

of Future History.

Our next contestant today is called-

*aside* fuck are they called?

Ah yes, Hu-mans. Yes, well, come on up then, don't be shy.

Yes, big hand for the Monkeys. Big hand.

Yes, that's enough, shut up.

Right, hu-mans.

You know the rules of the game do you?

No? Well the main aim of

Wheeeeeeeeeeeeel

of Future History is...

Not to go extinct as a species.

Your species, well, let's just say things are about to get a little bit bumpy.

Now Margery here- MARGERY WAKE UP YOU LEPTON

Is going to give the wheel of Future History a spin and find out where the human species is going.

Could be amazing.

Could be mega shit. So let's see what you could end up winning.

Well firstly there are the utopias

They come in several flavors, there is:

Technological utopia. You might master automation, relieving all humans of labor jobs, banishing any need for human employment allowing your species to,

well, pursue whatever they want to.

Robotics and algorithms will tend to almost all unwanted work and facilitate blissful daily living.

Since there'll be no scarcity there will be almost no conflict

Meaning war vanishes, and humans live perpetually in peace forevermore mostly eating nice food,

Reproducing very loudly, and having a jolly old time.

Okay, I hear you ask. But will there be dogs?

Yes. There will.

There's also AI utopia. machine intelligence is able to assist if not take over a number of human projects including science, design,

administration, and diplomacy. And streamlines and improves each area respectively,

and radically raises the general global standard of human living for all-

and no Skynet shit.

There's also scientific utopia: aging is treated as an illness and cured. Disease has also been eradicated

Death has become voluntary, particle physics is finished, and a successful theory of everything unites general relativity and quantum mechanics

(called string theory). The origin of biology is understood. Toast no longer falls butter side down

Consciousnesses explained scientifically.

The mechanisms of reality itself are now out in the open, and your race is no longer a bumbling pack of confused idiots.

No offense.

Then there's ecological utopia: your species begins living in harmony with nature,

Stops being dicks to the planet, and returns to a subsistence way of living in conjunction with high technology.

Industry still exists but is entirely sustainable,

And Mother Nature is allowed to reassert her sovereignty over the planet.

Everything is kind of organic

But not shit and hipstery, just... nice

Political utopia: political conflict is rendered pointless and citizens never have to worry about their offspring ending up in Wars

Governments are able to put their energy and influence into improving the welfare of their own citizens and the world goes full-on Scandinavian

Oh, yeah

Cake is free all the time and also there are dogs.

And finally the main prize,

Galactic utopia.

You begin colonizing other planets in the solar system

And maybe even perfect faster-than-light travel and colonize other star systems, too.

Even if there's an extinction event on your home planet, your race will now survive indefinitely

Up until all cosmic resources run out or you reverse cosmic entropy itself.

The golden age of trade and cooperation dawns,

As well as exploration of the known and unknown universe, and humanity is unified into a single great empire.

Humans finally take their rightful place in the heavens,

utilizing entire galaxies for energy to fuel their godlike projects.

Knowledge and wisdom guide your civilization forever more,

Petty squabbles are a thing of the past, the very cosmos itself revels in your success.

It goes without saying that there's free cake and dogs and stuff.

But, for every utopia there is of course a dystopia

And if you bollocks up the future you might instead get

Technological dystopia: technology is instead used for controlling populations including constant surveillance and mass misinformation.

No, one is considered an authority on anything anymore.

Possibly humans are genetically engineered in such a way that they cease to be human or most of their functions are outperformed by machines.

Humans are obsolete and miserable and technology serves to enslave rather than liberate your species.

AI dystopia: Artificial intelligence either commandeers or subverts human history and does not have the species best interests at heart,

Or is too powerful with not enough safety parameters. In short, everything is either miserable or thermonuclear and game over for the entire species.

Ecological dystopia: you mess up the planet to the point of no return, over fish the oceans, ruin the atmosphere, etc.

Earth is no longer capable of supporting mammalian life, and extinction ensues for your entire species.

Political dystopia: either earth becomes united by a single tyrannical government or most governments turn tyrannical.

But in any case, it's horrific, and politicking has been perfected to such an extent that no one can effectively rise up against it.

Possible lasting famine, enslavement, utter depravity and ruin for the species with no hope of recovery.

Or the non galactic scenario:

Humans never bothered with reaching other planets let alone the rest of the galaxy.

A single mass extinction means total obliteration for silly petrol monkeys,

and a human space Empire is never constructed.

Mankind goes gentle into that good night.

Wild animals reclaim the cities,

Satellites fall back to earth, and within a few thousand years,

Passing extraterrestrials wouldn't even have an inkling your species ever existed, let alone flourished for a time.

And there are a few other scenarios of course.

Maybe you merge with technology to become a cyber species

Or there's a Nickleback revival tour,

Or political collapse returning you to the dark ages and never recovering,

Or you use genetics to elevate other species to the level of human sentience and immediately regret that decision,

(Dolphins fucking hate you by the way.)

Or you create simulated reality that's so convincing and malleable, humans mostly lose interest in actual reality

Assuming this is actual reality.

Or you reach the end of Technology and find out the lots of stuff just isn't possible,

And instead stay content with free cake, and dogs and stuff,

Which is alright.

Or one of 10 million other disaster scenarios. Economic, political, technological, whatever.

Meaning the obliteration of your species.

And that is the wheeeeeel of future history.

And those are the rules.

So how do you go about winning, then?

Well, that's a bit more complicated.

If you can wield technology your ancestors never dreamt of and use that power in a way they would be proud;

If you can utilize your birth planet without destroying it, yet still take all that you need;

If you can kill labor without killing ambition;

If you can create administrations without giving birth to tyranny;

If you can think as a collective without losing individuality;

If you can expand your reach without diminishing your integrity;

If you can unravel nature without thinking yourself smarter than her;

If you contain the elements without subverting them;

If you can build your homes on distant worlds while still taking care of the home you evolved on;

If you can safeguard for future generations without forgetting those who came before;

If you can accept your violent pasts while still fostering your galactic future;

If you can spread across the Stars without your empire spreading too thin;

If you can take to the Galactic stage without forgetting your lines;

Then yours is the cosmos, and everything that's in it.

And more than that,

Then you'll be a mankind my son.

Then you'll be a mankind.

Well, it's time.

Marjorie, spin the wheel please.

So good luck. It's been an absolute pleasure watching you develop as a species, I guess.

And you know petrol monkeys,

You've done some pretty stupid shit over the years, but there is cause for optimism. Because despite all of your idiocy,

you've still somehow managed to find the time for...

Exploration,

science,

technology,

culture,

civilization,

philanthropy,

fiction,

genius,

collaboration,

language,

the arts,

endeavor,

curiosity,

daring,

persistence, and rationality.

Look, you've survived hundreds of thousands of generations, yeah?

Famine, drought, and war. And you've got a global civilization now.

You might be living on other planets in no time, or cracking the really big secrets of nature,

Or just getting over all your monkey rubbish and having a good time.

You're gonna feel mighty silly if you screw it all up because you got too clever, or too fighty, or too apathetic.

What do you think those are? They're not window dressing, they're an invitation.

But you have to behave yourself until you get there, all right?

For the sake of everyone who came before and everyone who will come after, there may not be another chance now.

Don't fuck it up, monkeys.

Not before you conquer your primitive tendencies,

Not before you spread out into space,

Or at the very least,

Not before all your great ambitions have finally run dry.

Title: [English] gramar explaned [DownSub.com].txt
This is not a badger's moustache,

or an excessively ugly pelican,

it's an apostrophe.

The king of punctuation.

And boy, is it being misused on a regular basis.

Sometimes, apostrophes make stuff possessive,

like if Tom has... say,

significant doubts about that last gram of bath salts.

The doubts belong to Tom, right?

So those are Tom's significant doubts about that last gram of bath salts,

and we give Tom an apostrophe.

If the noun already ends in an 'S',

like Dolores, and Dolores has... say,

some reservations about huffing a third can of

Lemon drizzle coloured Dulux paint,

then the apostrphe goes after the 'S' to make it possessive.

So, Dolores' reservations about huffing a third can of

lemon drizzle Dulux paint.

Apostrophes are also used for contractions,

like 'it's', which is just a shortened version of 'it is'.

You don't need an apostrophe to make it possessive.

For example,

if the cat shredded important financial documents,

then that's 'its mistake'.

If we give it an apostrophe, it makes it short for 'It is',

and the sentence is 'It is mistake' which is non-English!

Boy, commas are also tired of being messed around.

"Let's eat, kids!", which is a healthy exclamation while dining,

as opposed to "Let's eat kids!", stating rather explicitly-

you are, in fact, a cannibal.

However, commas can't just be cast in any old role though.

They aren't fucking- Matthew McCommahey.

and throwing in [breath] willy-nilly commas will lead [breath]

to a fractured [breath]

sentence.

Myself, I am on team Oxford Comma.

An Oxford Comma is the optional

(but not really optional)

comma one uses in a list.

Here's an example:

"Let me introduce you to my wife, my best friend, (Oxford Comma)

and my sister." Sounds reasonable enough doesn't it?

If you don't use the Oxford comma, instead you get:

"Let me introduce you to my wife, my best friend and my sister."

So yeah,

good luck with that you Targaryen freak.

Moving on.

Hey, who's this little chap?

It's a semicolon, the pretentious foie gras of grammar.

But it's not! It's awesome and here's why and shut up-

Semicolons are tip-top for joining two ideas that have equal weights.

For example:

Semicolons are useful; (semicolon)

They also desperately scream "I'm a university gradua-"

It can also link two clauses that stand alone.

Such as: "I appear to have trapped my junk in a filing cabinet; (semicolon)

I might not be joining you for mojitos."

We should probably also talk about confused pronouns.

"After putting the cat in the car, Rebecca drove it home."

Oh I- I see, cats are now drivable, are they?

How big is said cat?

How does one operate said cat?

Mine doesn't even acknowledge my existence,

Let alone double up as a mode of fucking transport!

Imaginary plural possessives.

Hey, what's you guyses thoughts about that?

We have no thoughts about that, because that is a grammatical abomination.

"I made a 360 degree change."

Yeah, okay. Let's just visualise that one.

In your previous life you were, say, kidnapping dalmatians,

and turning them into burgers,

but after some consideration you developed a conscience

and executed a full 360 change and

and that's a circle, you're still making dog burgers, Jesus Christ!

"I made a one hundred and eighty degree change."

"I could care less"

Which means presumably, you do still care,

and you have a lot more not caring to get done,

so that's great, but it doesn't really communicate anything.

"I couldn't care less"

"First come first serve"

"First come, first served"

It has to be served, otherwise that would mean the first people to enter the restaurant

would unexpectedly find themselves working there.

Affect and effect.

Usually, people mean the verb Affect with an 'A'

because it means to influence something,

like "Your face is affecting my peace of mind."

To effect is to bring something arround,

like "After seeing your face, the government effected drastic legislative changes."

I.e. versus E.g.

E.g. is for examples, like "drugs are bad for you,

e.g. heroin, cocaine, Stellaris, et cetera."

I.e. is used for clarification.

Drugs are bad for you.

I.e. you sit down to play a spot of Stellaris over lunch

and suddenly a decade has passed and you're now thirty-eight.

and you still haven't got up to pee, and it's not even the middle of the fucking game yet!

Their, they're and there.

Hm.. This one is easy enough.

Well, 'their' is possessive.

If a troop of leprechauns is closing in on your position

with laser guided fusion powered sniper rifles,

then that's 'their' assault party.

If it helps, a good trick is to remember that 'their' is spelt like that

is because its.. right.

If we're using the contraction of they are though, such as the leprechaun assault team is here,

and 'they're' going to go full on Jules Winnfield when they get inside the house,

we use the apostrophe 'R' 'E' form,

because again, it's a contraction of 'they are',

And if we're using the preposition, such as:

"Shit, i lost the assault leprechauns, where are they?

Oh, just crouching sinisterly behind the wheely bin,

over there,"

then it's 'E' 'R' 'E'.

And finally, if you're curious, then your interest is Piqued,

if you say something nice, its a compliment,

but if it brightens someones day, then it complemented it,

and if someone insists on breaking the above rules, despite knowing exactly how they work,

well, fair enough.

after all, it's their language too, right?

No!

You aren't allowed to freestyle with traffic laws, or math!

So why language?

Need I remind you that political tensions are running high?

That a global pandemic could spring up at any time?

That the bees are rather poorly at present and we don't know why?

We're balancing on the bloody existential cliff edge here,

so with all that in mind, just

fucking

'I' before 'E' except after 'C',

alwight?


Title: [English] Thoughts From Your Deathbed [DownSub.com].txt
On your deathbed

you will think back in your life,

and you might have...

regrets.

You will wish you'd worked harder,

made more money,

spent less time with your family,

less time with your friends.

You will reminisce fondly

about all the evenings you stayed home alone,

so you could refresh Facebook

over

and over.

On your deathbed

you will be grateful for many things.

Thank God you stayed in that job you hated

for fear of rocking the boat.

Thank God you settle for friendships with total bellends

instead of making the effort to meet people

who were on your wavelength.

Thank God you ignored your dream career,

so you wouldn't upset your family.

On your deathbed

you'll be glad you didn't tell these humans you loved

that you loved them

before they were gone forever.

You'll be glad you spent years taking

passive-aggressive comments personally

from people who are probably just miserable dicks themselves.

You'll be glad

that you were too cautious

to pursue your actual passions in life.

On your deathbed

you certainly won't think back

on whatever it is you worried about constantly,

and laugh at how utterly insignificant it actually was compared

to what a fucking amazing time you could have been having

with a body that hadn't started falling apart yet

in an age more enlightened

than any that have come before,

while the people you loved was still alive.

You were young back then,

and that was a resource more sought-after than antimatter,

more expensive than a hero

in Star Wars Battlefront 2.

Life was fleeting

and luckily you wasted the entire thing.

What's that?

You only have an extremely limited period of time alive

well

better polish off another one then

to that German Dominatrix whose name you can neither pronounce

nor remember,

and then write a long list of things you do tomorrow,

which you will somehow find an excuse not to

for the four thousandth day running.

When you were young

you wanted a million things.

On your deathbed

you want only one

and that is to be young again

On your deathbed

you certainly won't start having awful realizations,

like how the point of making money

probably wasn't to make money,

but to do cool stuff with it for yourself and others.

That the point of a long life

probably wasn't to put off your real plans until tomorrow,

but rather to give you more time to pursue them today.

Now literally fucking now

that the points are being a talking monkey in space

probably wasn't to sit watching YouTube videos

by some pompous British knob end

but to have a good time with what little time there was

And to make other talking monkeys feel good, too.

You were born into an age

science fiction couldn't even imagine.

When your species had access to clean drinking water through magic pipes,

to practically infinite information through magic wires,

to devices that can materialize

pizza in magic boxes at your door within 1 hour...

or less.

Despite being surrounded by miracles on a daily basis,

despite being matter that has woken up,

despite the entire universe

contriving to create you,

you still convinced yourself that the odds were stacked against you,

somehow.

That all the good ideas have been had,

apparently,

and that everything is shit

for some reason.

So...

great.

However you saw it at the time,

the future was a branching network

of opportunities and adventure.

At any moment you could have begun the project of refashioning your life into what you actually

wanted it to look like.

There would be risks,

there would be bad days,

there would be stress,

but that was nothing

compared to the misery of realizing the entire lifetime had been wasted on doubts and

self-sabotage.

The hard road was easy.

The easy road was hard.

It took 14 billion years to make you

and only 90 to fuck it up.

And with self-doubt and apathy you did fuck it up.

But that is irrelevant now,

at the end

all things considered,

all beds made

or I's dotted and T's crossed

because...

On your deathbed

you will think back on your life,

and you may have regrets.

You will wish you'd worked harder,

made more money,

spent less time with your family,

less time with your friends.

And maybe even closed this tab on your browser

and began taking steps towards going off to your actual passions.

Back

when you still had your entire life ahead of you...

And really

only yourself...

In your way.

Hey, I hope you like books about the future

and physics and AI

because I just put one up online...

The first section anyway.

It's set partly in the present,

partly ten thousand years from now.

It has cats and squares and

cats and it's nothing like my other stuff.

There's also lots of sciencing,

mmm

your favorite.

Link below if you are interested,

link below if you're not interested,

link below if you are apathetic.

A massive thank you to everyone who supported the channel on patreon

I could not have written this without you,

and I am eternally grateful.

Thanks I hope you like it.

Goodbye

etc.


Title: [English] How Not to Do Brownies [DownSub.com].txt
I think I was about 21

when I lost

my mind

I was living in this house with my best friend and this couple

and the girl was cool but her boyfriend often had

red eyes

and the house always smelled really spicy when he came over

So, we'll call him

So, one night Sir Drugsalot said:

"Hey, I've got these

MARIJUANA

brownies, so let's try them, yeah?"

"Who made them and what's the dosage?"

I should've said, but didn't

And instead I said

So we ate these things and they tasted strong

Very strong indeed.

I ate two because I had a medical condition back then called

"being a fucking idiot".

We planned an evening of Mario Kart and cake

And watching the Matrix and deciding we were living in a simulation, etc.

But, around an hour in, Sir Drugsalord said he felt a bit unusual and was going to bed

"Sir Drugsalot"-I said-"You can't go to bed, you gave us these, silly"

And he said -"Yeah, but I didn't make them"

"What?"- I said

"Yeah, someone gave them to me, at a party...

...in Birmingham"

"IN BIRMINGHAM?!"

we all yelled.

"So, you don't know how strong these are?

These drugs from...

BIRMINGHAM?" *chaos at the door*

"It's fine" -he said.

And I guess that was when hell began

because it started to fell a bit like, hmm...

ahh, you know that feeling when you're going up in a lift

but the lift is full of blue fire

and you're convinced no one ever loved you

and you can't remember hoW TO FUCKING BREATHE?!

*IMPENDING DOOM*

Yeah, so...

Yeah, is like that, really.

Everyone else at this point went to bed, but I'm an insomniac

at least when I'm on

drug fueled existential journeys into the unconscious

anyways, so

I laid down on the sofa

for a bit.

I got the TV on finally and it was halfway through Texas Chainsaw Massacre

and I realized that I no longer had the dexterity to even change the channel

so I made the best of it, and just leant back

into whatever

was going to happen.

To the sound of hysterical screaming and revving chainsaws

I attempted to recede into myself

to that spot at the heart of the psyche

where the buddhists and hindus tell us

all our inner contemptment springs from.

And the quest took me down a river

curtained by glass vines

and geometries from other universes

where the circumference is nowhere and the center is everywhere.

And there it was. Finally.

Peace of mind. Waiting in the distance.

And when I came to my peace of mind at last

there was a note there, instead

and the note read:

Speech, motor control, memory

it all went out the window.

And as my mind fell apart like soggy bits of cake

I stopped trying to stay sane

and gave in.

Dead relatives appeared before me

desperately trying to say something but unable to speak

I saw myself as an older man

then an old man

and then a dead man.

I desperately looked for an "I" or "me" on the inside and found none

nothing to hold on to, just atoms pretending to be a person.

And then finally, I was just a mind floating in space

There was no history, no future

It had always been like that, I knew

I'd only been dreaming of being a human this whole time

something I did occasionally to stop from going mad

and now, I was alone, again.

Back in the real universe, where the only physical constant

were unrelenting horror

and infinite nothing

in all directions.

It had no beginning.

It had no end.

I would spend an eternity like this.

-said a voice

"Who's that?" -I said.

"This is your sub-subconscious, look, just chill out

Since we have almost infinite time here

we're gonna spend some of it making sure you don't make such a dumb mistake again."

Plenty of information exists online about how much you should be taking of a certain substance

given your height, weight and experience.

Don't be a silly sausage and gobble any old amount

It's your mind,

be smart.

If you must insist on taking mind-altering substances

make sure it's with people you trust

not bellends at a party or something

If you're of a skittish or neurotic disposition

hallucigens may not be for you

Nor may substances like cannabis

which in large doses, especially when eaten

mimic psychodelics anyway.

How long do the effects usually last?

Is it nine hours at this dose?

Well, then, if you're seven hours in

it's only another two hours if you're having a bad time.

You will be normal again soon.

Yes, the world is suddendly very confusing and even scary

but, to be honest, before you took whatever it was

the world was equally confusing and scary

you just had lots of time to get used to that version.

Besides, this one will be gone soon anyway

Be cool. Everything's gonna be okay.

Have a cup of tea,

wait it out.

Also, write to your mom, she misses you.

And stop eating frozen chips out of the bag you freak!

"Thanks" -I said- "that was...

whoa that was great!

Won't be taking excessive amounts of substances again in a hurry, that's for sure."

"Yeah."

"So, umm...

how much longer... do we have... left here?

About an eternity, right?"

"Yep."

"Just uhh...

just you and me?"

"Yesssss."

"You uh....

you wanna cuddle, a bit?"

"What?"

"Nothing!"

William Tell's awesome overture

Thanks for uploading Exurby :3

Also where is my mystery link?

I miss my mystery link :(

Oh it's already ending?

Enjoy your existential crisis!


Title: [English (auto-generated)] Problems With Mind Uploading [DownSub.com].txt
this is dr. Charles from pigeons bluff

and he has just invented a mind

uploading machine he invites his mate

professor Jeffrey spam hammer over to

test it out the machine that works like

this

professor spam hammer is placed inside

the machine the machine then scans the

position of every synapse and neuron or

some other science he's sounding [ __ ]

and builds up a model of the professor's

brain the model is then transferred to

dr. pigeons plus computer and digital

professor spam hammer then wakes up in a

computer simulated environment this is

called mind uploading okay but what

happens next problem is can we say the

digital professor spam hammer is

actually a person well probably yeah if

we can say he's conscious we can't just

murder biological professor spam hammer

because he's self-aware

if digital professor spam hang up also

appears to be self-aware we should

probably endow him with the same rights

we endow every other human with I'm

sorry I didn't quite catch that yeah

thanks I wasn't actually talking to you

at all but she is anyway problem spy can

computers even run digital minds maybe

there's something fundamental to me

Teague blobs and biology that makes us

conscious that can't be replicated on a

machine for example if it turns out that

wibbly magic souls make us conscious

there maybe you can't model with blue

magic souls on computers for some reason

in which case fine but it's a bit hard

to argue with that one

or if it turns out that something

quantum mechanically makes us conscious

then maybe you can't model quantum

mechanics on a computer for some reason

the problem is that if you ask someone

what is consciousness and they give you

any answer that doesn't resemble well

I'm [ __ ] err they are probably lying

we have no idea or consciousness is yeah

it might be a feedback loop it might be

a particular brain area doing fancy

tricks it might be tiny little

consciousness kittens frolicking around

in your hypothalamus we have no idea

[ __ ] off kittens however if professor

spam Hannah's brain could be scanned and

recreated on a computer it's very hard

to see why digital professor spam hammer

wouldn't be conscious - I'm sorry I

didn't quite catch that

yeah again nothing to do with you yeah

so you just interrupting Cheers now

since doctor pigeons Bluff spent most of

his money on variously coloured mankinis

he decides to earn some extra cash by

building more mind uploading machines

and selling them

which leads us on to problem two hi how

much computing power does it take to run

a digital mind if it's lots like a

government project maybe only around

three or four digital Minds will exist

in the whole world at any one time on a

scale of one to [ __ ] this is probably an

OK scenario because much like nuclear

weapons most of the people who get hold

of the technology won't use it for doing

awful [ __ ] hopefully but if for some

reason it takes only modest computing

power to run a digital mind and the

world and their mum can do it then

things get a little [ __ ] let's imagine a

thousand people have access to the

technology just normal folk and 999 of

them are ethical Emily's and only run

simulations of say dead relatives well

top respect to the 999 ethical Emily's

but what about that one mean Maxine if

me Maxine is feeling nasty she could say

take a mind copy from an unwitting

biological human then go on to subject

that digital human copy to experiences

most are nice like oh you know roast

them perpetually above a searing Inferno

or keep them constantly drowning in

simulated water or subject them to their

worst fears constantly whatever that

might be or force them to travel on

British trains for the company's and

system raising the ticket prices slowly

but steadily making it more and more

prohibitively expensive all the while

insisting it's necessary somehow for

some reason knowing that you'll pay

anyway even if it costs 45 quid to get

London one way which is more than the

cost the flight of [ __ ] Spain and

back because we're the Train company and

you're a pleb and you'll shut up and

like it meanwhile we're reclining in a

bath of your money smearing each other

in caviar and Nutella that we bought

with your money then sleeping off the

caviar and a teller orgy in a massive

four-poster bed and the pillows have

feathers in them no I'm just joking

they're full of your [ __ ] money or

just generally torturing digital Minds

in some horrific fashion without and fun

side notes if running millions of

simulations at a time really is possible

at some point then since there'll be a

million simulated worlds to every

real-world is statistically far more

likely we're living in a simulation now

than not so there's that anyway that

leads us onto problem fear should the

digital copy of Professor spam hammer be

treated as professor spamarama himself

or a totally new entity well that

largely depends on what you think about

teleporters if you put professor spam

hammer in a teleporter break him down

molecule by molecule then recreate him

somewhere else did you just murder him

and bring a duplicate to life or is

consistency preserved well that largely

depends on your theory of identity

fancy-schmancy big words ahead either

you're a fan of spatial tracking

identity or forum tracking identity

spatial tracking identity means that you

draw a line behind where the professor

has been and as long as the line isn't

broken we can say it's the same

professor when he gets into the

teleporter the line is broken so we say

he isn't the same professor spam hammer

this steps out of the teleporter he's a

copy and that's fine but if instead

you're a fan of forum tracking identity

then you might say things can be

considered the same if they retain the

same structure and since the teleporter

makes a perfect replica shut up

Heisenberg we might say that it is the

same professor even though spatial

tracking is broken he will behave the

same way remember all the same stuff

fine yeah great and what happens if the

teleporter goes and spits out another

copy and another and one more for luck

they'll all be identical and they'll all

claim to be the professor how can they

all be genuine which leads us onto

problem ful should we consider these

digital minds as new variations of Homo

sapiens and treat them accordingly as

before that depends on if we think

they're conscious exhibit r2 simulated

professors one is conscious the other is

not you don't know which is which both

appear genuine both get pissy if you

talk to them or force them to travel on

British trains both respond in exactly

the same way to your questions so how

are you going to decide which one is

self-aware

maybe you can't you just have to assume

they both are and if human biological

consciousness is just one form of self

awareness then digital Minds may be able

Title: [English] Bear and Goose at the End of Everything [DownSub.com].txt
Billions of years after the great galactic empires have peaked and science was finished. The stars began to die and no new ones were made.

and somewhere in a remote patch of space a bear came upon a goose.

"Hello," Bear said, "do we know each other?"

"I don't think so," Goose said.

"Well, Which civilization do you come from?"

"I don't remember what they're called," Goose said, "I think they had a few wars and watched TV every now And then, I guess"

"Yeah," Bear said, "that sounds like my civilization, too. Is yours gone as well?"

"Well they're all gone," Goose said, "we're the last ones left don't you know."

Bear looked out at the universe and knew goose was right. All the nebulas were coming apart. All the galaxies were withering.

"How long do we have," Bear said.

"Oh, not long," goose replied, "Very soon now the universe will collapse back in on itself"

"Huh," bear said, "what happens then?"

"Oh, Everything will be gone," Goose said, "no more walking, no more fun, no more swimming."

"C'est la vie ménage toi (So it goes)"

"huh," bear said again, "What was your civilization like?"

"Hmm," goose said. She pointed with her wing

"You see that star, my whole civilization began there. And that galaxy, they spread through the whole thing. Made music, wrote books,

married, divorced, lived, died, had wars, apologized, had wars, blew everything up. A billion years of Empire, millions of languages,

thousands of planets, and now... all gone"

"All gone," Bear echoed.

"And how about yours?" goose said.

"Well, my civilization discovered the workings of nature, knew how it was all put together, saw the logic in the chaos, built enormous

Starships, traded with thousands of other empires, traveled the entire cosmos, learned everything there was to learn, then came right back to where they started,

saw everything, gave up."

"Pity," goose said, "anyway the end will be here soon. It's been lovely chatting"

Goose closed her eyes and was silent. Bear looked out again at the dying universe and felt very sad

"What was it all for?" he said finally.

"What?" goose said.

"What was the point?"

"Oh, what's the point in anything," goose said. She closed her eyes again

An idea came to bear: "We know everything," bear said, "everything our civilizations knew"

"Sure," goose said.

"And we can do anything, we're all powerful."

"Well,. within limits."

"Well, Why don't we remake the universe?"

"Well that's impossible," goose said, "we couldn't survive the collapse, It's very close now

It's Just over there"

"Well, then we'll set the next universe up properly for whoever comes after"

Goose opened her eyes. "like how?"

"Well I don't know, make it more interesting, change the rules a bit. Come on, they'll never know. It'll be fun."

Goose considered this idea, she was very clever after all. Under different circumstances

She might have gone on TV talking about astrophysical matters, Neil Degoose Tyson perhaps

"All right," Goose said, "I'm listening."

"Well," bear said, "let's make everything based on subatomic particles this time. We'll call them..."

"quacks," goose said.

"hmm, a bit silly: quarks, how about that."

"Fair compromise," goose said.

Bear began setting up the new universe.

"And will make olives taste nice this time!"

"Okay, Good idea"

"And fruit will grow on trees"

"Sounds good"

"And every now and then after a good meal people will throw up a bit in their own mouths"

"What?" Goose said, "why?"

"I don't know, it'll be funny."

"Don't put that in," Goose said.

Bear put it in.

Then he organized physics and chemistry and biology and made them all interact, and built in emerging properties, invented quantum field theory

and debugged everything and added some DLC

He made water wet and deserts dry and Tom Hanks impossible to dislike and finally he was done

They marveled at the starting conditions of their new universe.

"It's still missing something," bear said, "Should we maybe add more purple"

"No, it doesn't need more purple," Goose said.

"Hey, maybe coffee should make everyone shit real bad."

"Don't put that in," Goose said

Bear put it in.

"There," he said, "perfect, let's get this sucker going."

"No wait," Goose said, "we're still missing something"

"We've got to make things... difficult."

"Difficult?" Bear said, "no

We'll make this the party cosmos: margaritas on trees, walking hamburgers that kind of thing"

"No," goose said, "look where that got our civilizations. Everything was boring, It was too easy"

"We'll make living tricky, but not too tricky. That way there'll be a point, at least for a while"

"We'll make the stars so far away, they'd have to get clever to reach them."

"We'll make nature just weird enough to be interesting, but not so weird they can't crack it"

"And we can't put the meaning of life in plain sight, it'll have to be a challenge"

"They'll need to fall in love or go backpacking or argue in the comments section of YouTube or something"

"All right," bear said. And made the changes.

They sat back then and admired their blueprint of the cosmos-to-be, no one could doubt that it was indeed: very pretty

Around them the stars were going out in bunches, now the light was dying. Infinite space was reclaiming its territory

"Is this it?" Bear said.

"This is it," goose replied.

"What will happen to us now?"

"Oh, we'll be gone, everything will be gone, then the new universe will start just how we designed it"

The darkness came down in silent curtains all around them. History was dying. Space gave a little whimper. The end was just moments away

"Goose, I'm scared," Bear said

"I know, Bear," Goose said,

"But it won't hurt, here put my wing in your paw and don't let go"

The last star died finally. Then space began to collapse into a point infinitely small, the laws of physics blurring into each other.

Time and space falling undone. Billions of years had come to this and soon it would be for nothing at all.

[Music Swells]

[The music fades to silence]

"Will they see?" Bear said, "In the next cycle, do you think they'll see how beautiful everything is."

"Sometimes," Goose said, "Only sometimes. All the time would be too much. Never would be too little.

"Every now and then. They'll see it sometimes"

"and that will be enough..."

Amazing as always, exurb1a

Have a great day Y'all!


Title: [English] Feelings, Pictures, and Ideas_ A very simple theory of why good stories are good [DownSub.com].txt
Recently we've got pretty clever with telling stories like setting the plot out of time, setting the plot in space,

Disregarding the plot entirely...

But I don't think much has changed about what we like in a story for all of our postmodern yada-yada.

Stories basically still just come down to:

"Does characters what we like escape fron this ungood situation?

I hope they don't get murderized or nothing".

"Does characters what we like love each other and want to make out and stuff?"

"Is what we thought the story was the real story?

Or is there a twist with the robot man or a dubious soap salesman at some point."

And while that's all well and gravy I'm going to propose a little theory of everything,

About why we like stories when we like them,

And why we really don't, when we don't.

And it's called Feelings, Pictures/Context and Ideas,

And it works like this:

If a movie or a book or whatever only cares about feelings

Then it's either really crap young adult fiction or daytime television.

We get that the characters have emotions,

We just don't really care because we don't understand where they are in their lives, or what's going on,

And they don't propose anything new.

If a movie or a book only cares about pictures or context, well, then you get a story

that's obsessed with the weather, or the cinematography,

Or what the moon looks like and everyone knows what the fucking moon looks like.

If a movie or a book only cares about ideas that's great, but it's usually boring a shit,

And you get unrelatable science fiction or art movies where people just vomit their opinions about things like no one does in real life... ever,

Except narcissistic pricks like, I don't know, youtubers... for example.

But if you properly pickle that pineapple and you include all three, you get a Classic,

when a writer or a director gets feelings, pictures and ideas working properly together,

We can forgive basically everything else.

I think that's why you can still watch "Citizen Kane" or "Twelve Angry Men"

Or even "Moby Dick", or "Shakespeare" decades or centuries later, and they're still brilliant.

They're addressing feelings we have today, about death, or love, or whales, or cry-baby Danish princes.

They're using interesting contexts like huge castles or the ocean,

And they're throwing us ideas we don't think about that much on a daily basis:

"Should you be or not be?"

"What's the big deal with movies Willy anyway?"

Further example... Everyone bangs on about the Empire Strikes Back being a superior Star Wars movie blah blah,

And that's probably because it definitely is, but if we apply the old feelings, pictures, and ideas model to it,

I think it's pretty clear why it was indeed amazing.

Well, there's certainly feelings: Everyone's in a pinch, everything shit, Darth Vader wants everyone dead.

There's interesting pictures: There's the pretty snowy bits, and a spacey bits, and the cloudy bits.

And there are lots of ideas: About loyalty, and sacrifice, and making out with members of your own family.

To be even simpler about this, stories just have to be about someone we understand,

Set somewhere vaguely interesting, and propose something,

Anything even remotely new that we haven't thought about too much before.

They are also required to make sense. The main character can then be a robot,

or a drug-addled horse or a personified teddy bear...

Haha, what a story, Mark.

For more popular examples of feelings, pictures, and ideas done perfectly,

There is the "Blink" episode of "Doctor Who" with all the terrifying garden features,

The entire first season of "Mindhunter", the Christmas episode of "Black Mirror",

"The Great Gatsby", "Cloud Atlas" (The book, that is.), "Catch-22", "To Kill a Mockingbird",

Original fucking "Bioshock" and "Wild Tales".

That's us, the storytelling ape. Sure we stopped pooping in the woods and huffing volcano vapor...

Well, maybe you did, but not too much has changed with human hardware, with the brain.

We still seem to be telling basically the same stories our ancestors enjoyed, and most of them center around

Romance, power and Chelsea robot people. Primal stuff... Right?... Yeah, okay.

Why? Because this is our condition, still, balancing between being animals and gods.

We care about base stuff, but we want a bit of clever extend, too.

We evolved in tribes, we love gossip and the feelies.

We evolved in nature, we liked scenery and context.

We also evolved the Lamborghini of brain areas, the Neocortex.

So we seem to be really into ideas like ethics, and politics, and putting watches up your bottom.

We're designed to feel stuff, see stuff, and think stuff.

Stories seem to work when they mimic those basic needs, and more than that,

Telling stories is a fundamental human activity, I reckon.

And if you needed to kick up the arse to make your own stuff, I will attempt to provide it... now.

I doubt you know much about who your great-great-great grandparents were.

I certainly don't know anything about mine, and truth be told it's very unlikely that your

Great-great-great grandchildren will know much about you.

But one day our distant descendants will probably get curious about who we were and what we thought about the world,

And they'll look back at the stories we're telling now.

To our literature, and our movies, and our video games, and our TV, and everything else.

That's how we build time capsules. Now to be clear, I'm not saying all our media is great,

But Hot Diggity we're making some good stuff at the moment,

And Hot Diggity I'm sure lots of it will survive for a long time after we're gone.

And the cool thing is that there's really not much stopping any of us from making our own stuff,

In one form or another. Not necessarily to be immortalized,

But just to have set a true thing about where we are now, because the world won't look like this forever,

And we won't be here forever.

Humans are transient, stories are eternal, or as eternal as will be getting anytime soon.

It's a little nod to future generations.

Hey, we were here. We felt stuff. We saw stuff. We thought stuff.

Love and kisses in the 21st century. And we also saw the first launch of the Falcon Heavy so fuck you.

It's debatable whether cryogenics or mind uploading will take off in our lifetimes,

We're probably not going to be the first immortal generation.

But if you can say a true thing about how we feel about the world right now,

And what it looks like and what we think about it, there is every chance that that will stick around.

Happy making things, mother lovers.

All the best.

Ciao.


Title: [English] We're the Last Humans Left [DownSub.com].txt
Our species probably began about 200,000 years ago.

And judging by the fucking state of us, I think we can all agree it was a terrible idea.

We are called Homo Sapiens, but we were not the first human-like creatures on the planet, however.

Homo Habilis were making tools about 2 million years ago,

Homo Heidelbergensis were building shelters about 700,000 years ago,

Neanderthals were probably just as brainy as us:

they wore jewelry,

maybe buried their dead,

and always passed the joint to the left.

There were at least 15 other human species we know about – and now they are all gone.

The last three surviving species of human were Neanderthals, who probably died out about 30,000 years ago,

Homo Floresiensis, who disappeared about 12,000 years ago,

and us – Homo Sapiens, aka...

BIPEDAL BASTARDS.

And if you hadn't noticed, we are still here.

So where be dem other hominids... yo?

Neanderthals, for example?

Neanderthals were probably stronger than us, a bit taller,

with a rather different skull and a bigger brain.

Then why are they gone?

You see, old Gary Neanderthal might have been a smarty-pants,

but we had a secret weapon...

which is mouthy word noises.

Speech is fine for dissing and cussing, but it lets you do other stuff – like organize.

This allows you to, as the evolutionary biologists put it,

F U C K S H I T U P

Neanderthals were hanging about in Europe, doing crochet, cracking open cold ones,

until around 45,000 years ago, when us sapiens turned up coming from East Africa.

And within 5000 years of meeting us...

They were gone. All of them.

[wind noises]

Combine that with the fact that we could make big wordy noises,

were socially complex,

and probably had domesticated doggos at some point for help –

and we were a force to be reckoned with.

So that was that. We were bumming around for a while as hunter-gatherers.

The land was often barren,

the climate was often hostile,

death lurked everywhere –

so, Portsmouth, basically –

but it really wasn't all bad.

We think the average work week might have been around twenty to forty hours.

Their diet was probably quite varied –

vegetables, fruit, nuts, insects, boza — whatever they could find.

And they weren't idiots.

Most members of the tribe had to know the core skills of survival:

which berries will make you dead immediately,

how to remember the terrain,

how to build tools, how to stay alive...

They were generalists. They had to be.

Anyway, that went on for a few hundred thousand years,

until we got around to developing agriculture – probably about 12,000 years ago.

And suddenly, "if we don't find food, we'll all die"

turned into "if you eat my food, YOU'LL die",

then into "ehhh, I'm full, but I'll eat some more",

and then into...

"Uhh, yeah, I'll have the gluten-free macaroon and the lactose-free avocado shake.

Merci beaucoup..."

And then we went off to build society.

Hooooow?

Scrawny, breakable, generally pathetic –

but enough about myself (lol dat twist tho).

We are not a formidable species physically. But we can do language.

And if you can do language, then you can do myths.

And if you can do myths – then you can conquer the world.

You will own at least hundreds of thousands of objects in your life,

because you believe in a myth called "money".

"If you give me this paper, and the number is right, I will give you stuff."

And the myth works, because most of us agree to play by the rules.

The same applies to universities, governments, nations – whatever it is.

It's not that these things are lies, it's just that they're abstractions that only live in our heads.

And if you don't have language...

you can't do them. You really can't.

And if you can't do them, you can't do big societies.

Language is probably the gateway to civilization.

And now... we own the fucking world.

But it's been quite a journey.

There is some evidence that around a hundred thousand years ago the human species bottlenecked

to somewhere between 3,000 and 10,000 humans in the entire world.

By definition, that made us an endangered species teetering on the edge of extinction.

One theory holds that this was thanks to a supervolcano in lake Toba, Indonesia,

possibly bringing in a volcanic winter.

And even if that wasn't the cause –

disease, strife, famine, ignorance and hardship weren't occasional visitors to the human condition.

They WERE the human condition for most of our history.

But here we are now – a most populated planet.

For better or worse, we have arrived.

It took two hundred thousand years to get to our first billion humans – that was in 1804.

But then we jumped 2 billion in 1927,

and then 3 billion in 1959,

4 billion in 1974 –

and finally, 7 billion in 2007.

And now, we are invincible.

We've outsmarted time, we've outsmarted death,

we've outsmarted crops, and disease, and the weather...

The state of the human union is strong.

What could possibly go wrong now?
[echoing]

I met a traveller from an antique land

Who said:—Two vast and trunkless legs of stone

Stand in the desert. Near them on the sand,

Half sunk, a shatter'd visage lies, whose frown

And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command

Tell that its sculptor well those passions read

Which yet survive, stamp'd on these lifeless things,

The hand that mock'd them and the heart that fed.

And on the pedestal these words appear:

"My name is Homo sapiens, hominid of hominids:

Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair!"

Well... Then again.

In 1977, a probe was launched into space, called "Voyager 1".

41 years later, Voyager 1 is traveling away from us at about 38,000 miles an hour,

and is now 13 billion miles distant.

And aboard Voyager is a message from Jimmy Carter,

the 39th President of the United States.

And the message reads:

"This is a present from a small distant world,

a token of our sounds, our science, our images,

our music, our thoughts, and our feelings.

We are attempting to survive our time so we may live into yours.

We hope some day, having solved the problems we face,

to join a community of galactic civilizations.

This record represents our hope and our determination and our goodwill

in a vast and awesome universe."

And were we able to include just a few more lines in that message,

to tell our spacey friends a little more about ourselves,

and our deep history, and our ambitions, and our ancestors,

Just maybe it would say that...

"Well... P. S.

We think shit went down like this:

Life probably began on our planet about 4 billion years ago – a simple organic machines,

we don't know how yet. Then a sudden explosion of diversity 500 million years ago.

50 million more years, and plants taking the land over; 50 million more, and insects have arrived;

next, the dinosaurs are taking the stage, 700 species at least,

ruling the planet for around 145 million years,

before something – possibly asteroid shaped – wipes them out.

But it's ok, because here come bats, and butterflies, giraffes, bears, hyenas, sloths,

vultures, mammoths, TURTLES – you fucking name it!

And then the rise of the primates, and 2 million years ago appear our first true ancestor – Homo Habilis.

And at least 15 other species of the Homo genus spreading out across the world

until about 200,000 years ago, when a new genus – our genus – emerges.

Homo Sapiens, large-brained organizers, talkers, thinkers,

capable of high abstraction, and building tribes and cities and nation-states,

capable of ending the world in a day!

We have stepped into an age of great technological potency, though there are gaping holes in our wisdom.

We've become a global superorganism, though we still harbor our tribal inclinations.

We've pulled a bunch of fuckups, and we're really quite confused, and alone, and, frankly, scared.

But we hope to enjoy the privilege of being a semicolon in history, rather than a full-stop.

So on behalf of the hundred and fifty billion who came before us, and our human cousins who didn't make it,

we just hope this message finds you well.

And we hope, when you find us thousands of years from now,

that we are well too.

In any case... please just write back.

It's dark out here.

And we're the last humans left."

music on the abacus were not gripping

the abacus correctly and a doctor who is

about to destroy a burger as well as the

majority of his left hand with the help

of if I am not mistaken a silenced

Walther PPK it's impossible because

language processing when you're good

enough is automatic and so that is not

you okay Jesus but what about high level

stuff what about playing instruments or

driving a car that must take awareness

that can't be automatic yeah okay

probably for the first one but if you

play an instrument you may have noticed

your fingers just know what they're

doing

automatically or if you drive if you

know it's possible to get from A to B in

a car and spend the entire time having

an argument in your head with your dad

because he still hasn't boy that [ __ ]

edge is sketched while never actually

thinking about changing gear or pushing

the pedals so high-level motor

coordination when you practice it can be

completely automatic - yeah okay but at

least simple motor tasks are in your

control moving a hand or a leg or

whatever yeah or not

very simply Benjamin Libet did a fairly

famous experiment with getting people to

press a button randomly when they felt

like him he was monitoring their brain

activity while they did this the weird

thing is that the brain seems to be

preparing to push the button a

disturbing length of time before people

were reporting choosing to press the

button itself there are problems with

this experiment for sure but it does

seem a bit like the systems underneath

you underneath being conscious might be

way more essential than the conscious

systems themselves and that choosing to

do stuff is maybe just the game the

brain plays afterwards to justify what

it was already going to do anyway maybe

okay so fear isn't you survival stuff

isn't you preference isn't you lots of

motor control isn't you Christ what else

is going on in there that isn't you well

a fair bit actually like oh you know

balancing when you walk or falling

asleep and waking up or remembering who

you are or where you are or when you are

or fetching memories in the first place

or taking all of the perceptions that

are coming in through your senses and

into a coherent picture of the world

that actually makes [ __ ] sense or

even just processing everything at the

same time or processing tax or

perceiving color or just pretty much

anything most of it is automatic or at

least not mediated by you consciously is

there anything in your brain that you do

control them

you silly clever mess yeah let's start

by you closing your eyes go on but they

closed they bloody better be nothing

nasty is gonna come up on the screen or

anything right

closed cool if you listen to my voice

for a moment and just try to ignore how

grating and pretentious it is if you put

everything else out of your mind all the

anxieties and the neuroses all the

sensations of your body you will find

that underneath all of that is nothing

but awareness there's no obvious you on

the inside there's no tiny cap pulling

levers and pressing buttons there's no

center to being conscious it's just

presence is just awareness there are

sensations and awareness of sensations

and then processes probably most of them

automatic you as a thing don't seem to

have a center if you look for one you

conscious you do not really exist not

concretely to be very simple about it

that is the idea anyway

garnon open your eyes yes scallywag

another automatic process in the brain

might be the system that says I am a

thing with a scent itself there is

something on the inside doing the

experiencing and it is me but maybe

there isn't maybe they're just [ __ ]

ism and what then

well insulting sign off followed by

jaunty classical music division a

hang on a second look even if you are

kind of a lie which you might be me too

you are still self-aware whatever

happens and that is pretty unique we

don't know how self-aware other animals

are almost no animals recognize their

reflection for some reason except maybe

some of the great apes possibly dolphins

elephants and Magpies for some reason

but a bigger question is if there are

other species in the universe and there

probably are and if they've been around

a while and they probably have are they

self-aware we always seem to make out

the advanced aliens we'll have gone down

similar lines to us starting as cells

going up and up building fast food

joints smoking doobies etc but would

they be self-aware necessarily like

maybe evolution accidentally made some

higher mammals on earth software because

it's better for problem-solving or

something in this one case maybe it was

just one of those weird drunken

experiments nature undertakes sometimes

like platypuses or Winchester maybe we

just got really lucky this might be a

one time trick in the universe and we

got to take it for a test drive and that

really gets one thinking because what we

need is a global holiday and we'll call

it being alive is [ __ ] cool day where

everyone gets the day off and just for a

bit even for a few hours takes the time

to remember that everyone you meet

however [ __ ] is kind of a miracle in

plain sight an ongoing alive is [ __ ]

cool day we'll all eat donuts and take

leisurely strolls in the park and be

cool to everyone and around three

o'clock solemnly put our hands on our

hearts and pledge the following that as

the sperm the won the race as the mud

that woke up as a blob of carbon

currently taking the shape of a human I

do declare that the world is [ __ ]

cool and being self-aware is [ __ ]

cool and I shall henceforth hold doors

open for people and fill pints right up

to the top with only minimal phone and

endeavor not to be a nob unless it's

absolutely necessary and I do hereby

furthermore declare the getting bored in

a universe this weird is unacceptable

and if that happens I should probably

take up the tuba or organize a water

fight we shall have bad days yes we

shall have good days yes all the while

remembering that most things in the

universe don't even have [ __ ] days at

all even if it's all a facade there is

something on the inside that knows it's

a thing and

is the cat's pajamas that is the

veritable lobsters bottom

oh and they'll be hats and free beer and

bouncy castles and I will see you there

carbon units receive a per job no cooter

Title: [English (auto-generated)] Meaning is a Jumper That You Have to Knit Yourself [DownSub.com].txt
this is Viktor Frankl he was a

neurologist and a psychiatrist he lived

through the concentration camps of the

Second World War he survived starvation

slave labor watched countless people die

you know what the concentration camps

were we weren't all on it anyway during

that time he had a revelation which was

this humans are an animal driven by

purpose

above all we strive for a sense of

meaning in our lives and if we don't get

it we get extremely extremely sad and by

the time I finished ranting at you today

I hope you will agree with this too for

the longest time a good day for a human

consisted of finding food finding water

and not getting eaten and even

though hunter-gatherers probably have

more free time than we do

chances are the focus of their lives was

to stay alive next we developed

civilization and along came organized

religion I'm not on religion

here believe whatever you like but

whether the notorious G OD does exist or

not it arguably gave humans a purpose in

the universe we were special we were

loved sometimes and we actually meant

something in the grand scheme of things

lately though things are getting a bit

complicated if you're listening to this

there's a very strong chance you will

never live through a war directly you

will never experience belong starvation

or have to worry about getting access to

clean drinking water I say this not to

kill you but just to point out how much

has changed for lots of us however

whereas before the purpose of one's life

was focused around not getting dead or

remembering to worship the God of your

choice today lots of us have more time

to think about life and we still don't

have an agreed sense of what we're doing

here there is a shadow in the background

of modern life it is best described as

having enough food hopefully having

enough money to live on not needing to

worry about lions and still being sure

that some vital thing is missing and

that missing thing Viktor Frankl argued

is meaning

Fraenkel noticed that lots of his

patients had the sensation of total

meaninglessness in their lives

he called this the existential vacuum

when I got my cap I asked the vet what

the cats need please and she said food

water and fuss I give her these things

and she seems as far as I can tell

pretty cool with the whole arrangement

at no point has she demanded to know the

purpose of her existence or the correct

interpretation of quantum mechanics it

doesn't seem that easy to satisfy humans

though because we are very very clever

animals and oh look it's half-past pop

psychology o'clock maybe you know about

Maslow's hierarchy of needs is not

accepted by everyone but it's a pretty

good rough guide so we're fairly sure

humans need basic stuff first food water

sleep Attica Attica then security and

safety and no gettin numbed by lions yes

then belonging and love as in family

intimate relations then self-esteem to

be respected to be appreciated and then

finally self-actualization or becoming

that thing one actually wants to be lots

of humans it seems as somewhere between

here and here hopefully lots of us are

living in relative safety

and that's grand but the general message

of 21st century life for being self

actualized at least in some parts of the

world is making dhamanis or by loss of

property or something and then you'll

miraculously be happy and fulfilled well

nothing wrong with money or houses but

it seems pretty evidential that is not

enough for purpose and happiness in

herself a few reasons that is hinted

that having money does actually make you

happier unless you win the lottery

interestingly and you probably

link below but there does seem to be a

limit a Princeton study a while ago

suggested that above about $75,000

happiness and well-being doesn't

increase that much above a certain

threshold of being able to support

yourself and your family most humans

don't get too much happier above that

with money alone so something else is

required for happiness

happiness is one of the few things

humans try to achieve for its own sake

but there's a problem with happiness

which is the most of us seem to behave

thinking well when I bought finished

driven built completed X I'll just be

happy forever and nothing will ever hurt

again if you've ever tried being human

you may have noticed that this is not

how happiness works ever usually over a

long enough period of time humans revert

back to their baseline hedonic setpoint

their default happiness position this is

called the hedonic treadmill and it's a

fundamental part of the human

condition but what's interesting is that

there doesn't seem to be a meaning

treadmill in the same way for example

one of the most significant life events

for lots of humans will be having more

humans eventually and parenting itself

seems to start off feeling pretty cool

but gets a bit stressful for

about 20 years and in those 20 years

even though the euphoria dies off and

many parents at times wish to eat their

young

the feeling of purpose does not die off

this also appears to apply to long-term

relationships that work and professions

people genuinely actually enjoy their

maybe difficult weeks or months but

overall if it's in line with what an

individual actually wants inherently

then the thing continues to be

meaningful for a long time possibly even

for life meaning seems like a far more

sustainable goal than happiness and

according to what we know so far if you

have the first the second often follows

even in hard times years ago I had a

 temp job in an office and I spent

the entire time being incompetent and

fantasizing about getting out and my

boss who was a nice lady seemed

genuinely happy filling in spreadsheets

and playing solitaire when the big boss

wasn't looking and she was very clever

so one day I asked her why she liked

working there and she said that when she

was little she used to dream about

working in an office and having a desk

and going to the coffee machine blah

blah and now she was living the dream

and I realized that that moment just how

different humans motivations can be if

working there was in line with what she

wanted to do and she was happy doing it

which she was then who the hell was I to

tell her otherwise unfortunately humans

are not cats and food and water and fuss

just ain't gonna cut it

most of us seem to want to be trying at

something we enjoy but the spectrum of

human enjoyment is so vast it's

ridiculous so there's not gonna be some

magical human science that says all

right you everyone eat five cream

eggs a day learn the accordion get a job

as a telephone sanitizer and then you'll

find purpose in life

is something a lot more complicated than

that and Victor Frankel's position was

that finding an individual sense of

meaning is a journey the individual has

to undertake alone

sometimes you come across people who are

much older than you but a still

self-centered or compulsive liars or

whatever and it's worrying because you

assumed if you just live long enough

your work shut out and stuff will be

fine and here's someone who lived a long

time and somehow is still an awful

person one day I was talking to a

Buddhist nun about this and she says

well obviously you have to try it being

wise or you'll spend your whole life

never growing meaning is a jumper that

you have to knit yourself that seemed

quite clever and quite true Oh a jumper

is a sweater to those of you living in

certain breakaway British territories

what was where we are now might be part

of a huge experiment in human history

which is give some people miraculous

technology give them education and Mars

bars and VR and see if that provides

them with a purpose in life for some of

them lots of them it doesn't seem to the

question then is yeah yeah thanks for

the technology in the education and

everything but life still feels empty on

some level for some of us and what the

hell do we do now

please

every age has its trials the existential

vacuum might be ours if you take away

the constant threat of death purpose is

given back to the individual and that's

bad and that's good if one actually

pursues some individual sense of meaning

whether it be in love or work or

whatever that's grand

if not an entire lifetime can be spent

and many have been spent doing nothing

about it

the game of life begins with you

appearing on the outskirts of this huge

dark forest you ask a few people what

we're all doing here but no one

including your parents or teachers

really has a clue now you're told that

inside the forest is real life and if

you go in you'll have to do battle with

all sorts of monsters like loneliness

everything feeling futile jobs

people being vindictive your own

limitations not knowing what you

inherently want worrying about income

worrying about disease the death of

people close to you universal human

stuff right but facing up to it actually

saying you I'm gonna learn or make

or become whatever it is we'll just

refuse to die on the inside despite

living in a universe that is clearly not

kind and where suffering is inevitable

that might be the only way of achieving

some sense of individual meaning what's

that Ray Bradbury line ask no guarantees

ask for no security there never was such

an animal and if there were it would be

related to the great sloth which hangs

upside down in a tree all day every day

sleeping its life away just being alive

in the first place is ridiculous

and it's amazing that most of us are

even keeping it together at all it's one

thing to get called into creation

without being asked first it's an insult

to injury then be expected on top of

that to work out what the hell you're

doing here in the first place and I

think there's a pretty good chance the

Viktor Frankl and a bunch of others have

already shown us how to beat that

problem purpose seems to be personal it

comes from the inside from a sense of

enjoying one's work from living around

people one actually loves from striving

to know even if only in a small human

way for a short human time what we're

even doing here in the first place

individually if not that then what the

hell was the point in being here and if

that feels like a challenge well that's

to be expected because everyone else is

playing the same game whether they admit

it or not however much older however

much more powerful they

might be what is it with these pricks

will meets a party sometimes who claims

they've got it all worked out you

serious

have you even noticed where you are

you'll finally just being called into

creation are you you're all right we're

just popping down the shop for an

ice-cream and pretending anything makes

sense are you kidding me

oh yeah welcome to existence everything

is confusing the universe is actively

hostile and you don't even know what the

conditions for your own happiness are oh

by the way your sentient me standing on

a living spaceship best of luck coming

to terms with that one yeah like getting

very confused about all this isn't

entirely natural for literally everyone

like we have anything more here than

just each other no one knows what

they're doing

everybody shits and really no one knows

what they're doing and that's all right

that's to be expected knit your own

meaning jumper if you can lots of other

humans did and it seemed to work out for

them cool rant over good luck with your

 lives then oh what's that it's

the Prince of milk that book I wrote

ages go out as a paperback finally you

can get it on Amazon if you want it's a

story about what happens when the gods

misbehave basically it has a new cover a

new introduction and you can actually

hold it in your hands and by E


Title: [English (auto-generated)] Hymn for Goldilocks [DownSub.com].txt
there is a universe no one knows this

name where gravity wasn't strong enough

to bind mattered together and no stars

formed and because no stars formed no

stars exploded and because no stars

exploded no planets came about and

because no planets came about there was

no life

there's another universe no one knows

his name where gravity was strong enough

and did like the stars and planets came

about and boy they were gorgeous planets

in perpetual winter planets and

perpetual summer planets that could

rival the Garden of Eden and no bloody

snakes and on one of them eventually

complex life evolved and one of the

species developed large brains learned

things like manners and dabbing and they

looked up at the stars and wonder what

they were doing here

you could them octopuses I suppose gosh

they were clever for octopuses on one of

them several million years in almost

wrote something in ink on the seafloor a

message to its friend and the message

almost read hi how are you a few

millennia later space folded back on

itself and you get the idea goodbye

octopi

there's another universe where life

formed on every planet in every solar

system and it was carbon-based it was

silicon based it was made of crystals

and water and plasma he was made a

quantum fields and light and everything

was alive everything was doing a boogie

and it was everybody's birthday every

day relatively and everyone got presents

and they had over a trillion languages

some written down some only spoken some

conductor telepathically and they bought

a galactic civilization together as a

perfect unity sharing stories sharing

technology speaking a common tongue

understanding everything about how the

cosmos been put together and finally

when everything was sorted the galaxies

were arranged into perfect geometric

formations transmitting pure love and

wisdom and birthday greetings to all

species in the universe

for all time papercuts never happened

coke came in glass bottles

no one even remembered the word for war

everything was beautiful and nothing

hurt and yet through a quirk in their

evolution because resources weren't

scarce enough on the planets these

species developed on not a single

creature in the universe was conscious

food was eaten and no one enjoyed it

movies were released and there was no

laughing or crying no one chuckled at a

joke ever space collapsed back on itself

eventually and there hadn't been a

single moment of sentience in the entire

history of creation

there's another universe where the

strong force is too strong and the weak

force is too weak and nothing forms

another where life develops too late

when the stars have all gone beyond the

light boundary and there's nothing to

even see and other with too many

dimensions and other with not enough

another where time goes in the opposite

direction and species begin as gods from

wine backwards to cells and never

learned to survive another that only

lasts milliseconds and collapses in on

itself and heads straight back to

oblivion and that's how it just might be

across all possible universes across all

possible space times problems with the

laws of nature not enough resources

missteps in evolution an atlas of dead

ends

[Music]

then again there is one exception

there's another universe a big one where

life is rare where intelligent life is

very rare indeed the stars are very

distant from each other the laws of

nature are very complex it's extremely

lonely for any species developing and

most never even develop at all but

somewhere we believe is a planet where

the oceans are vast and the climate is

varied where the smarter species on the

planet may have developed just the right

mix of ambition and kindness and if you

were to travel there to this

unbelievably rest is just cool anomaly

to this impossibly lucky planet where

evolution biology chemistry nay the laws

of physics themselves have come together

to create sentient intelligent life you

may be able to catch the native

inhabitants singing for joy for what an

impossibly lucky and requisitioned they

find themselves in it is a chance of

gratitude a ritual of showing

appreciation for ending up in perhaps

the one universe in the one solar system

on the one planet with all the basic

ingredients for intelligent conscious

life it is a hymn for Goldilocks son at

all times of the day in every language

on every continent and it sounds

something like

Title: [English (auto-generated)] 10,000 More Years of the Scientific Method [DownSub.com].txt
it's funny isn't it we got all of this

technology we've got all of these clever

machines but if anyone actually asks

like how does any of it work at all

often the best reply you'll generally

get is yeah well probably someone built

a box and a Wizards bluffed in it and

now it's magic

and that's how technology works

everything's just made a wizard juice

and that's cool that's cool but yeah I

just want to put a bit of an alternate

answer out there that like yeah

technology is really complex and the

world is really complex but overall as

it happens actually the world isn't

wizard jizz technology's not magic it's

just scientists on acid or applied

mathematics and every piece of

technology from satellites to shoes

started in someone's [ __ ] head for

example segways not magic fizzy Cola or

magic Spacey science-based not magic

magic marker not magic it all just

relies on foundational physical

principles which will briefly discuss

now hey this your keeps time good right

is it clockwork or what it's just tiny

dragons or tough in their talons to EDM

no is quartz we know if you Electrify

cause to put some regular vibrations and

we know 32,768 of these vibrations is a

second so if you build a circuit the

councilors vibrations you can keep back

here at time and you just multiply these

together until you get hours days and

years all thanks the little white

crystals that aren't magic hey no all

that shabby is this some kind of

wizardry nope just good [ __ ] science

and piezo electricity or yeah computers

there has to be magic right no gets an

to purify sound make silicon ingots make

them wafer thin do some fancy ionship

and etching electroplating layering and

stuff and now what you've got is a

little slab of silicon packed with

transistors which are really just tiny

little electricity gates and you put

them all together in such a way that

they form an electronic mind consisting

usually of stuff what goes in control

thing thinking thing stuff what

remembers [ __ ] when stuff what comes out

the computer is just a little prison for

electrons where we train them to solve

problems really quickly and this will

relies on the principles of subatomic

physics meaning the most common use of

quantum mechanics in the 21st century is

undeniably most likely do more

probably all over Effie how does that

fly this simple right errand wings makes

a wound glide weight throwing a big

[ __ ] spinning thing right and if not

maybe some wizardry no flights a result

of a difference in pressure above the

wing versus below the wing and the cool

thing is that if you make sure the

pressure is higher below the wing than

above then low yo thus flight right yeah

also what the hell is an engine while

internal combustion is essentially the

process of turning fuel into motion

using [ __ ] explosions in a

four-stroke engine gas and air go into

the engine and the gas and air is

squeezed into an itty bitty space and

little spark starts a little explosion

forcing the piston to move then the

excess gas is released and that energy

is turned into rotational motion using a

crankshaft and this is generally thanks

to gasoline which is in turn thanks to

dead plants from swamps millions of

years ago not dinosaurs

further illustrating that like the world

isn't wizard jizz just weird and

prohibitive and really technology's just

nature we taught to do cool tricks and

to be honest can you imagine how utterly

miserable life was before we got around

to using the scientific method what's

the meaning of life and hey why does my

butt hurt just shut up invent fire and

get the [ __ ] in the hopper then die

prematurely from an easily curable

infection got a problem

tough luck baby natural selection

complex is not a synonym for magic

everything works somehow like a radio

what kind of Harry Potter [ __ ] is that

well first of all just imagine the

universe is made of interactions because

it is and one of them is

electromagnetism what radio is is a

certain wavelength of that and if you

vary electric current through a wire you

can create vibrations in the

electromagnetic field and if you have

something that can pick it up on the

other end and turn those waves back into

sound well that's that and those are

just physical technologies what about

language we're currently there's about

7,000 spoken languages in the world

some of them use grammatical gender some

don't some are alphabetic some a

pictographic but the one thing they all

have in common is that if you learn one

you can read people's [ __ ] minds and

this technology took thousands of years

to build and is basically the reason we

have modern civilizations and it's not

magic most language processing takes

place in the cerebral cortex we think

about native speakers usually know about

twenty thousand thirty five thousand

words but there's plenty people who

speak multiple languages so closer to

sixty thousand words or more and did we

find language at the top of a mountain

or in

or some [ __ ] Oh No Kluber deaf people

gave it to us and talking of deaf people

the difference between our ancestors and

us were mainly reason and rationality

look there's a good story about

Descartes he was one of the fathers of

the scientific method basically and one

night he had a bunch of wacky dreams and

in one of them an angel came to him

apparently and said the conquest of

nature is to be achieved through number

and measure and that surely has to be

one of if not the most powerful ideas

we've ever had scientific objectivity

nature can be understood using

mathematics then controlled using

technology and as long as we remember

that the world isn't in our heads that

the universe has a character where there

may be no limit to what will one day be

capable of with technology rationality

is absurdly powerful as the reason we're

not sitting around in our own excrement

it's the reason the average high

schooler knows more about the world than

the smartest human did not a few hundred

years ago is the reason lots of us are

living better than every emperor in

history and Jesus Christ look what we've

done already

antibiotics or moldy bread in essence

has probably saved about 200 million

lives since it was discovered your phone

has more computing power than all of the

computers the NASA used to send humans

to the moon and scientists are now using

lasers to listen to black hole

collisions billions of years ago by

distortions they left behind in the very

fabric of [ __ ] space-time itself

wizards and witches do exist and they

cast spells called research usually

abusing a magic potion called coffee and

if we don't know everything yet well

better to have questions you can't

answer than answers you can't question

don't you think and furthermore man I

don't if we mention this but uh

the world isn't wizard jizz and maths is

where nature should live say who got us

for the moon was it witches or

physicists and if we met aliens what hey

that'd be salient but they'd still use

technology science and astronomy will

most likely weren't dreamt our players

use in his chariot we started out as

slime and a [ __ ] precariat the world

is complex but when you really look into

it even biology isn't magic not really

abrupt ending so we can lead into the

next musical section you know it's weird

we used to build stuff mainly to stay

alive and to make other people stop

being alive but then we started building

stuff to stop from getting bored and

then we started building stuff to work

out how things work and that is the

kicker because the more you know about

how stuff works the more you can build

even more clever toys and we're getting

really good at that

now and My giddy aunt a strange times

ahead cue the synth wave would you

Timothy I don't know if you were taking

notes loss entry but we started it not

knowing how to fly and we ended it with

moon landings and nooks and the nap key

imagine if this century is anywhere near

as insane key imagine the godlike

technologies will soon be wielding good

and bad how about affordable rocket

trips for getting everyone in the world

online or a neuroscientific explanation

of consciousness or halfway successful

nuclear fusion or fully truly immersive

VR or the birth of an actual science to

combat aging or the death of disease or

convincing AI companions or Maskell

automation of Labor and administration

or proper spaceships that write light

the universe is a chessboard technology

works because we started learning what

the moves are that we can make on the

board and we're getting better and

better at that game all the time and

there's no sign of it slowing down and I

mean can you imagine

give us another hundred years of

scientific research and see where we are

give us another thousand nake give us

ten thousand give us ten thousand more

good years of the scientific method of

careful research and clever application

and intelligence and make we're going to

be gods we're gonna close ourselves in

immense power we're gonna kick cancer

and out sign as an MS right in the dick

we're going to invent new diseases just

to cure them for fun we're gonna build

gargantuan starships we're gonna occupy

entire galaxies we're gonna step outside

of history we're gonna pilot destiny

we're gonna burp plasma we're gonna eat

lightning we're gonna [ __ ] algebra we're

gonna build Dyson spheres on our lunch

breaks we're gonna fold space and tame

chaos we're gonna reverse entropy we're

gonna travel through time you're gonna

cultivate the perfect wisdom we're going

to solve the riddle of being we're gonna

have entire weeks when no one's unhappy

anywhere we're gonna befriend the fourth

dimension it is going to be Brock Lesnar

[ __ ] it's gonna be the Rubicon all over

again it is going to be [ __ ] biblical

but even then

then it still won't be magic or

witchcraft just really really advanced

manipulation of the fundamental physical

laws of nature made possible by the

scientific method by the acknowledgement

the nature is bigger than us and the

hers is the only game in town the

scientific method might not be much good

for telling us who to marry or how to

live a good life but god damn is pretty

much got everything else on its to-do

list I mean how else to put this

like if two people were trying to build

a rocket and one guy tried to run his on

liquid oxygen and the laws of motion and

the other filled his with Dragon Pierce

and good intentions who do you think

could be sipping a cold one on the moon

about three days from now

the world isn't wizard jizz

so you've just invented time travel well

done you clever little sausage let's go

back and fix human history then before

you leave though

why not pack a suitcase but what to take

what to take

well obviously shoes toiletries clothes

and depending on how your time machine

works how about a [ __ ] spacesuit

because if your time machine works like

a teleporter what do you think is gonna

happen when you push the Go button let's

say you want to pop just five hours back

in time to breakfast well the earth is

orbiting the Sun at about 67,000 miles

an hour so you're not going to

materialize at the kitchen table you're

going to materialize where the kitchen

table will be in five hours meaning the

earth is now 335 thousand miles behind

you you doink all right so let's say

your time machine isn't a teleporter but

just nuts even ignoring the fact that

the earth and Sun are also traveling

through space together with the entire

galaxy and the galaxy is going at about

1.3 million miles an hour so you'll

probably just end up in interstellar

space alone and dead and alone and dead

yeah but really let's just say your time

machine is I guess you could launch

yourself in a rocket fly out to where

the earth is going to be in exactly five

hours

somehow traveling faster than the galaxy

good luck then turn on your Time Machine

and hope you got the calculations right

so you don't end up materializing in the

ground when it catches up with you but

really okay let's just say your time

machine is never even then what you're

just gonna re materialize in the air are

you what about the air you're displacing

when you pop out of nothing how dense is

a person well about 985 kilograms per

meters cubed while air is about 1.2

kilograms per meters cubed so when you

arrive there'll be a huge compression of

matter as you materialized causing at

best a bit of a whoosh noise and at

worst a cheeky touch of you know nuclear

fusion

so really let's assume your time machine

isn't a teleporter there's something

friendly like a closed timelike curve or

a wormhole or whatever gray so go

wrestle Jenga scan Pearson Caesars

lemonade now down to business from here

in we'll assume that a the past can be

changed and B you're a sociopath

let's see if we can nudge humanity off

in a better direction then shall we step

one don't be dead

before going back in time why not make

sure you stay the [ __ ] alive pack

antibiotics lots and lots of antibiotics

especially doctor sillim if you're going

anywhere near the bubonic plague if you

run out of antibiotics and under no

circumstances do this unless you are in

fact a stranded time traveler you can

make very improvised penicillin by

leaving moldy bread until it goes

blueish also if you aren't getting water

from a well or the rain or an aqueduct

how about don't drink that [ __ ] ever

boil all of your water first then you'll

need to filter it when something bottle

ish add a layer of charcoal layer of

sand okay in a chair you just beat

diarrhea step two get clever before you

go read up on the basics of steam power

harmonic oscillators pendulum clocks

germ theory modern military strategy

monarchic history the schematics of the

printing press and all the card tricks

you can stand use a mnemonic technique

to commit stuff to memory a good one is

the person action object system let's

say you want to remember the dates of oh

I don't know solar eclipses for no

reason in particular will aim for

memorizing about 30 of them so pick ones

in the time and location of whichever

era you're going to now you need to

remember the date of the Eclipse and the

exact time of day now come up with at

least 10 people 10 actions and 10

objects so let's say we're trying to

remember the number 3 to 6 well 3 in the

people list is Winston Churchill 2 in

the objects is wash and 6 is a unicorn

so Winston Churchill washing a unicorn 3

to 6 is easy to forget but good luck

getting that image out of your head

though next to memorize any embarrassing

secrets we now know about the monarchy

of the time you're going to and

congratulations you now have the

foresight over God

now packs in gold and silk a nylon and a

laser pen and an air horn and some

special jockeys because yeah personally

as an English native speaker I would

wander back to 14th century England

because a it's before the Enlightenment

that people will be way easier to

[ __ ] and be further back and there

isn't enough metallurgy and they'll be

speaking Old English but it's your time

machine do whatever off your [ __ ] then

upon arriving if I were you I would rig

your time machine so you can't possibly

go

before whenever you've landed otherwise

if you screw up you might be tempted to

go back again and again and interfere

with yourself

creating a shitstorm of temporal

paradoxes anyway welcome to the past it

smells weird and everyone talks funny so

step three then become a living deity

but first remember the English is a bit

of a work in progress and even just

decades back from our own century in

your sounds suspicious

stick to the hundred most common words

in modern English and you'll hopefully

be alright still if you open your mouth

in public you're boned locate someone

vaguely trustworthy but not too clever

give them some goals make sure they

understand your instructions from now on

they speak for you next you need to

dress up in all that silk and nylon

nylon won't be invented until 1935 and

silk is to wear in Europe at the time

people will love that [ __ ] now introduce

modern music the rhythms are so alien

that people will immediately flock to it

My milkshake brings all the lads to the

courtyard they're like it's better than

yours jehovah is better than yours that

could teach you but I checked with the

priest grant next go out in the streets

and get your spokesperson to announce

the next solar eclipse which you

memorized people are going to freak out

a bit so let off your airhorn a few

times flash your laser pen about a bit

make a song and dance of it yeah when

the solar eclipse happens immediately

announce the next one and claim it to

you doing it if people say hey you

didn't do that just say yeah yes I did

teach your followers basic hygiene

teaching the modern battle strategy

teach them the foundations of royal rule

and how flimsy it is people might talk

funny in the past but power still relies

on more or less the same foundations as

today namely weapons and money the

monarchy will send an army and they will

attempt to make you dead you can't win

against that however clever you are

so instead incite revolution most of the

monarchs of the time retain their power

by the threat of violence and the

promise that god put the map by divine

right invent Gutenberg's printing press

decades before Gutenberg begin churning

out pamphlet after pamphlet laying out

the embarrassing secrets of the current

king step up antibiotic production cure

people of basic ailments move you and

your followers to a remote patch of the

countryside declared independent give it

a flashy name perform miracles every now

and then card tricks will go down really

well probably people haven't seen them

before in Europe have your followers

track down the finest engineers of the

day I would recommend filippo

brunelleschi and keto TV even or begin

constructing basic steam engines use

them to pump clean water up from the

ground for all your mates and followers

have an elaborate underground temple

built for you disappear inside with your

time machine only let your spokesperson

come out and give orders leave behind

extremely specific instructions for how

to begin the Industrial Revolution early

and grow your army and maintain your

future Empire and design good irrigation

finally have a very basic periscope

constructed and stick it at the top of

your temple so let's travel a few

decades into the future and see how

everything is going

slowly accelerate the passage of time

day and night will begin to pass visibly

in front of you until the Sun appears a

single golden line across the twilight

sky the seasons fleeting by in seconds

the fevered commotion of insects no more

than a blur than the flurry of passes by

our sight of generations waxing a waning

of great structures built in your name

the fingerprints of science and

philosophy born long before its time the

drumbeat of Industry coming alive the

development of modern medicine of

scientific materialism of the mastery of

nature of the acknowledgment of the

right of all humans to exist in a state

of international economy tea the dawn of

an age when millions need not die of

disease of hardship of war

you steer humanity now there have been

leaders and thinkers and sages

throughout history but none of them had

your advantages now you can refashion

history in the image of dignity who

kindness and universal concern for every

human alive and all of it presided over

by you half human half deity moral just

indomitable indefatigable how noble in

reason how infinite in faculty in

apprehension how like a god Wow

I mean not a god technically because

people can still revolt against you and

you can't do anything about it so let's

try a few changes in tactic to protect

your master plan direct technology

towards absolute surveillance of the

population towards a perfect political

science towards total hegemony if you

want to help humanity you'll need to

live a long time

so order your scientists to research a

cure for aging drop by to collect the

rewards of the new sciences and become

immortal enhance yourself with

electronic augmentation the problem with

humanity too much freedom and leisure

time remove both banned books ban mass

communication rule undisputed technology

in your left hand power in your right

dropping in occasionally to make

alterations or dispense great justice

and retribution in the name of peace

Shepard humans up to the local planets

establish colonies then spread out to

the Stars create a Galactic Empire ruled

with imperious malice last humanity

revert back to its bad habits there'll

be no love except the love of you

there'll be no art no literature

total domination unimaginable power

unlimited rice pudding who could stand

in your way now who would [ __ ] dare

as monarch of the galaxy as pilot of

history as God emperor of time

knowing I'm just putting the kettle on

do you want off of [ __ ] what does that

say on the door mum 25 metres swimming

certificate the other one

don't come in recording right so well

sorry I just wanted to know if I'm too

Title: [English (auto-generated)] and then we'll be okay [DownSub.com].txt
at the foot of the law

last village and in the last village

lived Tao it was towers birthday while

he was working in the corn his friend

Samuel shot of hims come quick

Tao ran to the edge of the village where

the death barrier was and beyond the

death barrier was his father lying on

the ground Tao ran to his father his

father wasn't breathing

Tao dragged the old man back over the

death barrier and the village doctor

checked his father over the doctor said

I'm sorry he's dead the snake did this

the next day the village folk came to

Taos house and said his ananda shames or

if you're lost and so on and tell

thanked them and then he was alone again

he hoped he would get good at being

alone soon

that night he watched the great mountain

glowing with the light and madness of

the new gods who knew what they were

doing up there when Tao slept he dreamt

of the snake that killed his father its

fangs curved like scimitars his eyes

full of rage and malice and prior did

all the evil oh that exacted on the

village folk for hundreds of years

bringing disease and misery and now it

brought death to his father enough Tao

got up just before dawn he packed some

water and food into a satchel then went

to the pyre where his father had been

cremated and took his father's ashes and

put them into a jam jar then he walked

out to the boundary of the village to

the death barrier stop someone yelled it

was the village doctor you step over the

barrier you can die leave the snake be

you can't fight him Tao closed his eyes

and stepped over the death barrier and

walked out into the wilderness

[Music]

tell trudged about the forest all day

looking for the snake but found nothing

he saw his father's face in the trees

where had his father gone this man who

given him his time his love had taught

our how the world worked he'd brought

our breakfast in the mornings and

blankets in the evenings he brought him

up

but his father had gone off into the

dark alone now and town knew he couldn't

bring his father breakfast or bring him

blankets or bring him back the snake the

bastard he would kill him

towers out of water and thirsty he spied

the great mountain above the trees and

walked towards her but the foot to the

mountain was a river and he drank from

the river for a long time when he looked

up again there was an old woman sat a

few feet away on the ground the old

woman took a swig from a hip flask tower

turned to live pay the old woman yet

tower ignored her she searched you look

like someone with unfinished snake

related business Tao stopped what do you

know about a snake green one bough yeah

hi she said maybe she pointed up the

mountain I saw him when that way he did

did he now Tao said oh yes and a mighty

sneaky sneaky wiggle he had about him

also yeah tell begun to walk away that's

where the snake lives you know the old

woman said on the mountain that's why he

thinks up his evil plans and he was

mumbling something about how I just

killed an old man - well that was beyond

coincidence

tell thought maybe she knew something

Tao started off from the mountain

instead Hey

the old woman yacht but tower ignored

her he walked for some minutes before he

spied another figure ahead sat on the

ground it was the old woman again how

did you get here Tao said she took a

draw on her head flask

you need a guys she said a chaperone

he's awful tricky to beat old snickles

Tao said not to be rude but you're drunk

and old and a bit useless really you are

being rude she said tower walked on but

she followed behind I know things she

said I know things about the snake and

the new gods - rubbish

tell said is it the old woman said take

me up the mountain and I'll teach you

how to kill the snake I'll kill him

myself with my bare hands

tal said

no the old woman said no you won't they

looked about under rocks then in holes

but the snake wasn't Beth he must have

gone further up and so they climbed

they slept rough and in the morning

their breakfast fatale it was bread for

the old woman it was her hip flask they

continued walking up the mountain by

midday they were high enough to look

down on the landscape properly and there

was town's village I'm remarkable just a

few buildings and wisps of smoke in the

valley but there are other villages in

the world

tell asked no weather yes when a long

time ago they used to be very big

villages called cities once lots of

people back then what happened ambition

the old woman said she drank from her

hip flask say boy when you kill the

snake and he's gone you think you'll be

happy forever then yes tower said

without pausing hmm the old woman said

hmm they looked about under rocks then

in holes but the snake wasn't there he

must have gone further up and so they

climbed they slept rough again and

worked to a grey and sickly dawn they

set off in silence and soon they came

into a fog that collected about their

knees the air smelt metallic the

daylight looked wrong what's happening

now said the old woman said nothing only

switched on her hip flask tell us or

something in the dirt

silver uncomplicated what's that he said

old science the hag said what science

the old woman said sort of like magic

but it works there were more machines

now silver glass great hours of geometry

and Industry who built these things Tao

said well the new gods of course

why have they abandoned them because all

children get bored of their toys

eventually she said and about them

appeared lines and symbols esoteric

glyphs in the air and lights flashed in

the distance and a great wind picked up

and the metallic creaking grew thicker

the rocks were not rocks now but

hexagonal metal slabs and the trees were

twisting candles of crystal and a head

glowed a pedestal and upon the pedestal

was a set of spectacles the old woman

picked them up here boy she said these

are the glasses you'll know the snake

with glasses tacit my visions fine no

it's not she put them on his face

suddenly towers pulled from his body and

senses and saw the world but

masks on a tangle of fields and

dimension the height of time the width

of space and he knew then that matter

was both the point and a wave and a joke

and he saw the logic at the bottom of

everything the madness at the top and

the shape of becoming and the dance of

decline and finally then he saw himself

in true perspective a speck on a block

on a smudge on a blemish on a fleck in a

grain of galactic sand and made a

billion other beaches that those beaches

themselves only made up more grains of

sand and more grains of sand and more

grains of sand and more grains of sand

and more grains of sand

the old woman removed the glasses what

was that tower whispered ah 31st century

science bit before your time she gave

him the glasses keep these safe eh who

are you

Tao said oh she replied who's anyone

they looked about under rocks then in

holes but the snake wasn't there he must

have gone further up and so they climbed

[Music]

the next morning they work after dawn

and have a fine view of Taos village

below Tao sets

why is the world dead the old woman says

everyone got clever now they're gone

where are they gone

Tao set and pointed to the sky there she

shrugged come on times getting on they

continued up the mountain the peak high

above the village low below tower

thought again of his father he imagined

the days ahead as empty and over castes

no one to talk to truly no more games no

more laughing when he found the snake he

would rip it apart he spied a stream

then and the water was red and he

realized it was blood the stream of

blood grew thicker as they climbed no it

was a river of blood and on the ground

when notes and coins and precious jewels

and staffs and scepters the ground was

scorched and from the ground rose

smouldering vapors in the air stank of

death and glory and Dominion and ahead

Taos bite a sword it was sticking out of

the soil its help glinting red and

purple and gold in the blade an opulent

silver they cycled closer take it from

the ground that boy the old woman said

what is it toss it that is the sword who

killed the snake with and with a great

effort to I wrenched the sword from the

ground and brandished it and great

plumes of fire and lightning let from

the tip and set the ground alight Tao

brandished it again and out shot swarms

of locusts and wasps and he bellowed a

great stentorian laugh and the laughter

echoed out over the plain of the

mountain everything was power everyone

would listen to him now the village

elders the Oracles the bullies and the

brutes hell even the snake when the time

came he laughed again and the mountain

was only fire and lightning them whose

only power and malignancy and rage thou

shalt always kill he thought and he knew

that no one could do a damn thing to

stop him ever again and more than that

with a dastardly certainty he supposed

with this thing he could end the world

if you wanted the next morning Tao ate

in silence and the old woman drank in

silence and they got walking as usual

Tao said how long until we find the

snake

the old woman drank said nothing is

nothing empty already Tao said she

turned the flask upside down and pulled

out a constant stream of booze that

didn't end are you one of the new gods

Tao said do I look in you your woman

said well what happened to the new gods

the snake

she said it killed them sure Tao stopped

well how in the hell do you think I was

gonna beat if it killed the new gods

the thought had crossed my mind the old

woman mumbled still the glasses and

sword will serve you well and we have a

few more things to collect yet

like what Tao said but already he heard

music upbeat calling t'aime they came on

the remains of a great party empty

bottles discarded trinkets what happened

here Tao said abandon the old woman said

in the ruins of an old nost in tatius

house but partly to the ground was a

tankard for gloat and inside the tankard

was what looked and smells like Mead go

on the old woman said drink a little

what is it

Tao said this is the indulgence you'll

kill the snake with and with that towel

drank and when the cop came away the old

woman grabbed towels hand and led him

into a dance the mountain began to spin

about them the colors blurring was

happening to tell you out and the old

woman yelled that's it

dance you bastard and Tao and the old

woman danced across the mountain over

the debauchery and under the moon and

suddenly tower was not thinking of his

father or the snake or the village

what if there's no point to anything the

old woman sang who cares who cares tower

great tragedies happen people die it's

all a game it's all a facade there's no

salvation no meaning he saw into the

heart of things now I knew there was no

heart that everything was suffering and

even that didn't matter a joke God was

playing on the world for nothing more

than his own sick amusement they moved

to the cliff feet stepping in perfect

time the stars spinning about at a

dizzying pace and the mountain echoed

with the music of reckless abandon and

nothing mattered now [ __ ] tell thought

and they danced the nihilist waltz long

into the night until the Sun began to

rise Tao woke with a throbbing head and

a mouth that tasted like death the old

woman was already up smoking a pipe oh

well she said hmm Tao mumbled was the

dancing really necessary he said the

woman nodded certainly was come on we're

very close now and the snake can't hide

forever I'm not going anywhere until you

tell me what the hell is going on

Tao shafted suddenly where are the new

gods where is the snake and who are you

yeah whatever come on then she sets off

walking but tower didn't move she paused

rolled her eyes all right all right she

muttered what's the year hmm three to

six Tao set by your calendar yes by mine

it's the 98th century your ancestors did

some wonderful things became very

powerful and wise all right

those objects the glasses the sword the

tankard these the things they left

behind relics relics of what I'll show

you know tauriel no more games

the old woman snapped them look she said

you're only doing all of this because

you think you killed your father he

asked you what you wanted for your

birthday and you said a meteorite so he

went out beyond the death barrier to

find you one and that's how he ended up

dead so don't take all this out on me

tower was silent awhile then said

quietly how do you know that because I'm

really really clever and I'm trying to

help you here so would you give an old

woman a break tell thought about this

and collected his things they walked on

in silence the village was almost

invisible below and the mountain peak

was very close they turned a corner and

came upon a picture of a king than a

queen they're more the portraits regal

and proud with faces the spoke of legacy

and divine right they pushed on and now

the portraits were of scenes touted and

recognized of battles and rulers and

machines and great structures that kiss

the skyline episodes from his species

history that he'd never even heard of

let alone considered millions dead and

gone whole nation states turned to dust

the great human project forgotten as

though a dream upon waking testament to

a time when billions existed on a

fragile marble among the

dark of space holding out against a

hostile cosmos and yet worse threats the

looked within themselves and somehow for

a long time against all odds and sense

they did hold out bettering themselves

slowly as a toddler attempts to climb a

set of steps then for some reason

devolving again the great sleep the

great forgetting sent to bed with no

supper then decline then savagery then

dust and a head Taos White was a pair of

armored boots there the old woman said

Who as long as you wear those you'll

never die you can live into your

thousands if you like this is the armor

you'll defend yourself with from the

snake they fit it perfectly and one more

thing the old woman said she took from

her shawl a necklace and on the necklace

was a locket and in the locket was a

picture of towers father she put the

necklace over his head to remember she

said this is the story you'll kill the

snake with he felt finally ready to do

battle since he'd begun his adventure up

the mountain he knew it would only be a

short walk now

the peak was just a few yards away it

was only a small plateau and the wind

was high here and it was raining and

there sat the snake its back turned to

tower staring off into the dead

wilderness below there you are the old

woman said do as you will with the

glasses of the new God's on his face he

saw the snake in its essence its black

heart its cunning mind its contempt for

the last remaining humans Tao approached

silently his heart in his temples his

eyes wide his hands clutching the locket

of his father and he thought of his

father then thought of the man dead

thought the futility of death when he

closed his eyes and screamed and brought

the sword down with such power that has

struck a grating chord

how into the rain and rang all the way

back to the mountains base he opened his

eyes the snake was gone

Tao turned around to the old woman where

did he go did you see him no said the

old woman I didn't see him because he

doesn't exist

the rain was getting heavier Tao stood

silently in his armor the old woman said

did you really think there was some evil

snake on a mountain bringing death and

misery into the village did you really

think the world was so simple the only

one thing is responsible for all the bad

days God what is it with you lot you

have everything you know that and you

spit on it like living in some enormous

mansion and one day you find a chipped

brick so you burn the whole damn house

down

you've got everything down there I gave

you everything endless food endless life

and you're still miserable [ __ ] do you

know how difficult it is playing deity

I'd give anything just to give up

knowing everything and on the skyline

appeared shimmering and translucent

buildings high technology and science

they got everything they wanted your

ancestors the old woman said and they

still weren't happy the snake was still

there misery chaos and death they tried

sending it away with perfect knowledge

they tried killing it with ultimate

power

they tried forgetting it with abandon

they tried living longer they try

clinging to each other the spectacles

sword tankard Armour and necklace they

looked about under rocks then in

but the snake wasn't there he must have

gone further up and so there climbed and

climbed and climbed and found nothing it

was just them in the universe and they

were still miserable so the New Gods are

all gone now all except me and your

species is gone - now all except your

village the old mode of living I keep

you lot around because it's a nice

souvenir - how we were once I'm sorry

your father is gone I'm sorry you'll

never see him again but there's a whole

village down there of people who love

you and here you are screaming at the

wind on a [ __ ] mountain bad things

happen and the reasons for them are

complicated

there is no snake in a witch no evil

genius and no never come a time when

everything lasts forever and nothing

hurts ever again but the strength is in

taking a good look into the abyss into

the eyes of the snake and then choosing

to still be a good human even in the

face of great uncertainty and malice and

that day when everything will be gone

forever it's not gone yet it won't be

for ages don't waste your time on snakes

and windmills say goodbye she took the

jam jar out of towels satchel and gave

it to him she put her arm around his

shoulder slowly to open the jar and the

wind took the ashes of his father and

flung them out over the mountain and in

the last light of dusk they were not

unlike a million tiny meteorites all

done with being cosmic and bound for the

everyday ground the old woman says your

species mine wants to we must be the

only creatures allergic to happiness we

ruled the galaxy a long time ago and

still quibbled over who got more ice

cream for dessert still wanted to

pretend we didn't come from the mud

still couldn't accept the meaning and

solace on to be found in the heavens but

in the trenches of everyday living we'll

know everything and then we'll be okay

we'll kill everything and then we'll be

okay we'll forget everything and then

we'll be okay

we'll live forever then we'll be okay

will cling to everyone and then we'll be

okay and even then we weren't okay

because that's not how the game works go

home now don't try to be a hero or a

sage or a warrior just exist for a while

and be decent

heroism enough is how it's always been

done hey you want to keep the glasses

and sword and tank it an Armour you can

rule the world if you like no Tao said

good choice

Tao said am I the first from the village

to come up after the snake boy the old

woman said everyone from the village

came up one by one I gave them all the

same treatment they all went back down

even your father God he asked a lot of

stupid metaphysical questions I can see

where you get it you're the last one to

come up here so go home be human the

universe doesn't give a [ __ ] about you

your village your family me we do

remember your dad loved him always God

knows he loved you and come up here

anytime you like you more hang out and

remember him together tower took off the

glasses in the armor and the tankers and

laid the sword down on the ground can I

keep the necklace he said of course she

said and the memories they will always

be yours too the curtain of ashes was

gone now the sky was clear and fine he

set off back down the last mountain

bound for the last village it would not

be a difficult walk and even if it were

Title: [English (auto-generated)] The Mystery at the Bottom of Physics [DownSub.com].txt
it's 1687 Isaac Newton drops the right

club banger called filosophy naturalis

principia mathematica introducing his

physics of gravity however it could be

argued and it will be because I'm

[ __ ] going to that perhaps his

biggest leap was his idea that the rules

down here on earth world are the same

rules that are up there in space world

so if a theory of gravity works for

apples which never fell on his head by

the way those bollocks then it will work

for stars galaxies and black holes -

sounds obvious enough to us living in

the future but it was revolutionary back

then and it changed physics forever and

anyway what what did you ever do bugger

all probably so just shut up anywho that

eventually led to the discovery of big G

or ger ger is the gravitational constant

and a guarantees that wherever you go in

the universe the attractive force of two

objects will always be proportional to

their masses and inversely proportional

to the square of the distance between

them the point as far as we know is the

big G never changes anywhere in the

universe ever it's a constant and

constants are important because the

universe is as mad as a bucket of

coked-up ferrets and depending on where

you are or what you're doing the speed

of time can go Wiggly the local strength

of gravity can change denoted by little

G or goo mass momentum everything is

variable we need things to hold onto if

we want to know what the really real

rules of the universe are so if you're

feeling social let's me some of the

fundamental constants of reality the

rules that dictate everything and the

speed of light doesn't matter what

you're doing how fast you're going or if

you wish your girlfriend was hot like me

the speed of light in a vacuum never

changes far as we know that means if

you're going at 1 meter per second than

the speed of light is traveling this

fast away from you and if you're going

at 298 million meters per second then

the speed of light is still traveling

this fast away from you if the speed of

light doesn't change ever then

everything else has to change around it

like time and distance and that's partly

where we get relativity anyway it's

called Kerr and it's a constant cool

but do the fine-structure constant this

is alpha it basically denotes how

strongly electromagnetism can [ __ ] with

charge stuff like protons and electrons

and it comes out as 137 that number is

so fundamental to nature that if aliens

contacted us before we reply with nudes

or pictures of cats sending 137 might be

the best proof to them that we are big

boys and big girls now and come say

hello please today

Planck's constant plunk gave us h which

basically defines the relationship

between a wave or particles frequency

with his total energy for one thing it

tells us that energy actually comes in

little packets called quanta and from

that we also get the Planck length mass

time charge and temperature these are

the master units of reality they're not

defined by silly human measurements

they're made of other constants if there

is a god he's probably using these to

boil his tea and put up his shelves

Fiera finally the mass of the proton and

the electron are also good yardsticks

for the universe since they don't change

as far as we know and they come in at

these values but I don't know what they

are yet because I'm writing this script

on the bus and I consider internet on

mobile phones to be the pinnacle of

millennial degeneracy now that's all

very interesting you might say but

whether the constants get those values

well before we fail to answer that it's

not just the constants that are set up

rather specifically in our universe it's

[ __ ] everything hey this is cool huh

so fundamentally we live in

three-dimensional space oh [ __ ] so we

live in three-dimensional space with one

time dimension which is fine but it's

not too silly to imagine a universe that

could have been set up with only two

spatial dimensions or four even and what

would for look like so you have the

usual vanilla x y&z axis and let's add

one more for funsies called w this is a

fourth dimensional axis so we've added a

whole new dimension to space now it's a

bit difficult to conceive of because

we're built for three-dimensional

thinking but you can see as you vary the

fourth dimension in the environment

everything goes a bit to put it

mathematically totally up the [ __ ] so

objects are moving through a dimension

we can't see and to us disappearing we

know this is mathematically possible you

could have a universe that works like

this or with even more dimensions but

the point is we don't know if three

dimensions is the only spatial way to do

things we just happen to find ourselves

living in a universe with them why is

our universe only three dimensional with

one time dimension as far as we're aware

no

has a clue it's not self-evident time

for a personal anecdote as the icing on

my genetic cake I was born more or less

blind in one eye and worse it would just

wander off sometimes if it got bought it

really was a piece of [ __ ] and in the

prime of my adolescence I felt a touch

conscious about this so I went to a

doctor and asked and he said yeah sure

has got assorted fun side note what I

didn't expect was that a while before

the operation to check you won't get

double vision from the surgery

they inject Botox into you surrounded by

15 very attractive student doctors while

you try to pretend you're totally fine

with a needle in your [ __ ] eye anyway

a while later they put me to sleep and I

woke up with some bandages and then I

didn't really have a lazy eye anymore

and that was it a few months passed and

the novelty wore off and then I got to

thinking how did they put me to sleep

anyway what is this anaesthesia nonsense

and I looked into it because I didn't

know how anaesthesia worked and as it

turned out no one else [ __ ] did

either we know general anesthesia stops

vital areas of the brain talking to each

other so you can't form memories and we

assume you're unconscious too or we hope

so but we don't understand the mechanism

yet and I couldn't believe this so we're

using this thing thousands of times a

day for opening people's skulls and rib

cages and all sorts and we don't even

know how it works and then you start to

notice this pattern everywhere the

things we use and trust all the time

without any knowledge of the mechanism

behind them our languages our medicines

the biology underlying sleeping or what

sleep is even for consciousness

imagination and then finally just the

world why natural laws work or are there

at all we know they keep going we know

we can wrap them up in equations but we

don't have a clue what they are ever

since then I've never been able to let

go of this horrible feeling but we're

living on the top of this enormous

iceberg and we've drilled down like a

foot into it but there's still 400 miles

of the thing below us that we can't see

and we don't understand yet here we are

living on top of it just going about our

lives as though everything's fine and it

all comes back to the constants start

with any phenomenon the fizziness of

lemonade the collapse the ching dynasty

the antics of deuce Bigalow male gigolo

and keep asking why it exists or why it

happened and eventually you'll come back

to the fundamental physical constants to

the rules of reality every explanation

stops somewhere and it almost always

stops here so WT [ __ ] where do the

constants come from them well maybe

got / digital overlords regardless of

one's religious persuasion it is

possible that an intelligence set all

this stuff up on a similar note it's

getting old fashionable of late to

suppose we're living in a simulated

universe where physics is determined by

someone or something else above us

maybe presumably though whoever's

running the simulation also lives in a

universe with laws so what determines

those laws then also if you ever noticed

every time we invent a new technology

that becomes the metaphor for everything

now if you've got a hammer everything's

a nail psychology used to be really into

theories about compression and diversion

of pressure I wonder where those ideas

came from

likewise recently we're getting really

into the idea that lots of stuff is

computation and simulation I wonder

where those ideas came from no doubt

we'll invent other clever stuff in a few

decades and that will be the new bee's

knees in our theories just saying

reality is really complicated and maybe

we don't have the right metaphor yeah

maybe we do anyway variation over time

another possibility is that the

constants aren't actually constant there

might be slowly getting stronger or

weaker this isn't that uncommon an idea

so the speed of light might be slowing

down for example there's a whole class

of these called VSL variable speed of

light theories however firstly we don't

have any definitive proof that the

constants are varying yeah there is a

possibility that alpha the

fine-structure constant is varying but

again we don't know the thing is if the

constants are constant we don't know why

yet and if they aren't constant we also

don't know why yet so maybe multiverses

a bunch of constants we found are set up

in such a way that if they were just a

little bit different things would be

catastrophic for us anyway

if gravity had been stronger or weaker

by just one part in 10 to the 40th power

then stars probably wouldn't have formed

at all so why is our universe so cuddly

and well made well maybe there are

squillions of other universes all of

them with slightly different constants

why the constants the ones we see

because we live in this universe not

these ones it doesn't then explain why

there are squillions of other universes

in the first place but still it's

getting there and finally hard logic

ality another fun theory is that there's

something special about our constants

and our physics that they're baked

necessarily into reality and I made the

term up so there's no point googling it

like it's tricky to imagine a universe

where pie doesn't dictate the ratio of a

circles circumference to its diameter

and

that universe had a very weird

indifferent geometry it seems like pi is

built into logic the idea is that the

mass of the electron the electric charge

of the top quark the furniture of

reality all of this stuff also derives

from logic somehow so all of matter pops

out of say pure geometry and one day

we'll find the necessary bridge between

the two and everything will be explained

from the bottom up anyway right now we

know lots about what the rules of

reality are but almost nothing about why

there are these rules and it seems like

we should be talking about that a bit

because if particles and waves and space

and time and us are the marionettes

there is a ghost above the stage pulling

the strings dictating how they and we

behave and we don't know what that ghost

is why is physics even here at all and

what the hell gave it its character

Einstein one says what really interests

me is whether God had any choice in the

creation of the world as in is this the

only way you can make a universe and

what is the origin of the structure of

reality

likewise Edgar D Mitchell was one of the

twelve astronauts to walk on the moon

and he said the most amazing part of the

trip was the return journey when he was

looking out of the window of the capsule

and he could see the earth and the moon

and the Sun and he suddenly realized

that every molecule in the spacecraft in

his body and the other astronauts bodies

had all originated from some ancient

star and he had this overwhelming sense

of unity it was all the same LEGO bricks

all part of the same game the same

cosmic tons of service and it's no

different for you and I just having

thoughts in the first place is made

possible by electromagnetism conveying

signals between neurons in our brains

but holding our molecules together as

well as the strong interaction kindly

keeping the nuclei of atoms specifically

the protons and neutrons in place

meanwhile the curvature of space-time

gravity has been keeping us from

casually leaving the ground like balloon

boy and going for a quick wander through

a passing jet engine meanwhile the weak

force has been quietly keeping quarks

transmuting regulating the nuclear

fusion that powers the Stars some of

which billions of years ago prototype

till the carbon nitrogen and oxygen in

our bodies allowing us to exist in the

first place and all of this has been

facilitated by the fundamental constants

of nature obeying the speed of light

gravitational constant and all the rest

the buttons the universe has done her

coat up with you know I don't have the

charisma looks or predilection for

orgies required to start a cult but if I

did we'd need something to dislike and

that would be this weird recreational

cynicism one comes across sometimes that

the world is boring and everything's

been discovered has it has it [ __ ]

really oh I must have been on the toilet

when that particular ontological memo

came through isn't it nicer and just

more honest in a way to admit we don't

have a handle on

yeah that there's nothing normal about

reality is just an insane jigsaw puzzle

devised by a madman that's persisted

long enough for us to accept as routine

and in a predictably ungrateful fashion

we still somehow invented a word for

boredom I don't know if you're having is

your time right now maybe work sucks we

are in a pinch or whatever and I'm

really sorry to hear that but may I

recommend that it is possible to put

stuff into perspective just for a moment

by remembering that every atom in your

body is the direct result of universal

laws we have no idea to the origin of

that there is in plain sight and mystery

could everything and nothing is

self-evident and really if we're honest

we don't even have a clue of the BOK

reality is doing here in a first place


Title: [English (auto-generated)] Misery was [DownSub.com].txt
anxious dissatisfied tired of waking up

in that hotbed of - drudgery and tedium

you've affectionately come to refer to

as your life

convinced that everyone else has their

ducks in a row while you lurch from

disaster to disaster like some rickety

tandem Victorian velocipedes caught in a

perpetual cycle of feeling good feeling

medium then returning to FEMA crap again

waiting for the day when you'll actually

find yourself in a good mood for more

than five minutes well there is quite a

good reason for some of that and it

begins as we all did with biology nature

uses two methods of making babies on our

planet boink and no boink no boink or

asexual reproduction is generally used

by bacteria plants and fungi and it

involves an organism copying its genetic

material for the next generation boink

or sexual reproduction usually involves

a male and a female doing the nasty and

combining their DNA 50/50 to produce

offspring and that's the one we'll focus

on here species change over time due to

two main factors selection and mutation

selection means the organisms better

suited to their environment have more

chance of surviving and so reproducing

they will also often choose mating

partners with what they consider

attractive qualities or phenotypes for

example often deer like big antlers

peahens like colorful plumage the male

bowerbird attempts to attract ladies in

the form of a bachelor pad called a

bower which takes sometimes months to

decorate stupid birds humans would never

make such silly displays for mating

purposes would we

is mutation mutation means that

sometimes there are glitches in the DNA

of offspring and this could be due to

copying errors or even cosmic rays in

humans it can mean anything from red

hair to genetic diseases sometimes these

mutations will then be passed down to

the next generation of offspring and if

they're beneficial for survival will be

sexually selected and even become a

characteristic feature of the species

through circumstances we still don't

understand humans have developed

relatively large brains and outsmarted

normed or avoided every other species on

the planet

good old survival of the shittest and

while we pride ourselves on being

fantastically clever very little has

actually changed in terms of hardware

between prehistoric humans and modern

humans because evolution takes ages as

we know now modern humans are sneaky of

course we've taken the old evolutionary

urges and drives and found ways to still

enjoin them aggressive combat into

competitive martial arts for example or

a constant obsession with reproduction

turned into an act you can do thousands

of times across your lifespan and never

actually make offspring but evolution is

not a smart or conscious process some

things are not well designed a narrow

pelvis for example making childbirth a

thoroughly enjoyable experience for

women everywhere or standing up which in

return for a better line of sight and an

ability to grab stuff also kindly gave

us sciatica and hemorrhoids in return

however we've also inherited the mental

traits evolution kindly gave to our

ancestors including creativity curiosity

speech a low anxiety threshold a bit of

a tendency for pessimism and a token

inability to keep right on the London

Underground escalators the signs are

[ __ ] everywhere we are a

contradictory mix of animal and mad God

but we may be this century on the

threshold of gaming technologies to

alter our evolutionary blueprint

courtesy of genetic engineering going

into our genome and ripping up the

floorboards so what shall we do then

make ourselves harder better faster

stronger eyes on elbows and ability to

actually piss in a straight line first

thing in the morning all very

interesting but there is one particular

evolutionary bad boy we might rewire the

so fundamental to the human condition we

barely even notice it's there and its

name is misery

we are not designed for sustained

happiness or optimism

natural selection had very little

interest in our mental welfare survival

was key as a result it seems most of us

regardless of geography or social

standing have a hedonic setpoint that is

something good might happen and you'll

feel good for a while something bad

might happen and you'll feel bad for a

while but eventually you will probably

return to your baseline which appears to

be set out of your control

partly genetically for some individuals

this setpoint is rather high for the

rest of us they yeah not not so much and

that's ignoring all the other pitfalls

of brain 1.0 including age-related

dementia self-loathing a tendency

towards addiction a tendency towards

addiction a tendency towards addiction

low boredom thresholds and everything

else we didn't ask for genetically

speaking these nasties have haunted us

for millennia and they seem to form part

of what we've lovingly come to know as

the human condition which for many of us

is just shorthand for stuff we can't

change and we're [ __ ] and it's natural

and have a cup of tea and get on with it

but if we crack the ability to send

these evolutionary dishes back to the

kitchen to engineer ourselves happier or

more content shall we [ __ ] give it a

whirl or not after all we've got such a

great track record with limiting the few

godlike powers we already have hem hem

hem hem hem if we do gain mastery over

our own genetics how far should we go

with this one and how the hell will we

know when to stop now luckily genetic

engineering is really simple and there

are no risks and genetic engineering is

really simple you see there's a single

gene for everything

a cleverness gene that tallness gene a

really good-looking gene and they can

just be turned on and off without

affecting anything else and there being

no bad consequences and genetic

engineering is really simple there's

definitely no risk of making horrific

alterations to the human genome that

only become apparent generations later

there's no risk of nasty folks creating

engineered drug resistant pandemics that

are virtually impossible to eradicate

there's certainly no risk of a group of

us getting hold of the technology and

creating an entirely separate genus of

humans we can't possibly compete with in

any aspect whatsoever genetic

engineering is unbelievably

complicated and it's not hard to see why

people are extremely cautious

we are currently children who have just

about learned the genetic alphabet or we

can't read yet so what can the new

genetic technologies actually do well in

each of our cells is DNA DNA is packed

within chromosomes chromosomes are

extremely long strings of DNA composed

of four bases a T C and G lengths of

these are called genes and proteins are

built inside your body as a result of

genes if you like genes are genetic

verbs telling proteins what to do

we've been genetic engineers for four

centuries now breeding species for the

sake of characteristics move on in

doggies for example small ones big ones

the bestest ones [ __ ] love Springer

Spaniels but even that goes wrong

sometimes many species of doggies are

adorable but possess nasty inherited

traits like hip dysplasia and epilepsy

thanks to us and this is just simple

genetic engineering we haven't managed

to get right yet so far we've been using

hammer methods but now we may be holding

a scalpel method called CRISPR and it

works

roughly briefly like so some bacteria

can store an intruders DNA in their own

DNA in the genetic library called CRISPR

or clustered regularly interspaced short

palindromic repeats and using that as a

template using an enzyme called caste 9

it can kick ass if the intruder comes

around again

researchers have hijacked this trick and

have begun to user to snip out targeted

sections of DNA in other organisms

considering there are thousands of

diseases caused by a mistake of just one

letter

not too much alteration might be needed

to fix all sorts of nasties latent in

human DNA this isn't a question of if we

start radically altering human biology

its when because even if most of us

condemned the technology is not as if

other researchers won't pursue it

they've started already obviously

hopefully we'll begin with eliminating

genetic disorders but surely there will

come a point perhaps this century when

we get a little bit more experimental

and the question is what happens then

well we might be children at the moment

but we know enough to notice the certain

genes when they're present accompanied

specific traits Dec 2 for example is a

genetic mutation allowing some of the

humans you have it to survive on around

6 hours sleep a night but genetics is

rarely one gene equals one trait there

isn't one intelligence gene and they

probably isn't going to be a single

depression or makes hummus delicious

gene either what we know from twin

studies though is that somehow very

specific traits can be inherited there

may not be a single good at violin gene

but there might be a bunch of genes the

into being good at the violin the one

might inherit from their parents like

decent hand-eye coordination and pitch

sensitivity but in any case genetics is

not a switchboard happy on sad off

bada-bing let's go for a pint it is an

interconnected tapestry in which some

traits are caused by loads of genes

potentially thousands and small

alterations could have horrific

consequences

there's nothing prudish about being

cautious when it comes to a cheeky bit

of the old playing God let's plant a

flag there for a moment because if we do

one day learn to speak fluent genetics

alongside changing ourselves physically

and potentially shepherding in the

[ __ ] apocalypse we could scout out

the roots of the more unpleasant aspects

of the human condition of low mood of

self-hate of depression anxiety of the

hedonic curse of the genetic foundations

of misery itself and if for some reason

this all goes well which there's no

reason to suggest there has to then you

and I might be living in the last

century in which anyone was ever

involuntarily suffering mentally

speaking mental well-being is I would

argue the most important factor in being

alive because it's the first thing that

makes being alive worth being alive like

if you weren't conscious nothing else

would matter and even if you lived in a

solid-gold mansion and slept on a bed

made of Faberge eggs and brushed your

teeth with dolla dolla bills if you're

miserable you're still miserable Gucci

gang gucci gang if there's a possibility

of one day altering the human condition

perhaps the goal should be to preserve

our humanity but attempt to overthrow

our evolutionary curses for example

using these new technologies to raise an

individual's baseline happiness default

without compromising the individual's

personality much like the difference

between you with a hangover and you

after a workout and oh is that Aldous

Huxley at the door with some reasonable

criticisms though he can start off thank

you this is wild speculation then again

some pain makes sense if one is sat

around eating crisps and gaming all day

it might be entirely appropriate to have

that nagging feeling the time is being

wasted a form of deep evolutionary

signaling to go out and actually engage

with the human tribe or if you've lost

someone close to you you know the

grieving is horrible but it gives you

time to try and make sense of who you've

lost and in the end you can hopefully

come to terms with it in a

psychologically healthy way there are

plenty of sensible warning messages

written into the human psyche but others

are over compensations or just bad

genetic luck what the hell is the

beneficial aspects of lifelong

depression for example

oh it's time for a disclaimer there's a

trend in media the eye and perhaps you

find a bit irritating which is when

someone will be pretending to be

objective but really just trying to beat

some kind of pet theory of theirs into

your head labeling it philosophy or

common sense or something and using

fancy big words what comes next is

purely my and a few other people's

crackpot theory and speculation and

that's it and real researchers without

your qualifications in the field of

genetics you don't have enough time to

make youtube videos because they're

actually busy doing something beneficial

for Humanity are rightly careful about

speculation because the real world is

really complicated and they're frankly

probably rightly fed up with champagne

futurist types like myself making wild

speculations about the future while

facing no consequences for being wrong

there is no reason to think genetic

engineering will be chocolate and cat

cuddles it could go badly in a million

ways for a million reasons and if you're

using this channel for educational

purposes in the first place you have to

be totally bonkers because it's just me

the cat some cuddles with the cat shirt

are like yelling into a microphone about

no qualifications whatsoever in genetics

and a big old box of [ __ ] to fifi

purely speculation a head or white or

white that being said though in the

event that we do develop competency with

these new genetic tools the future of

biology is going to be stranger than we

even capable of imagining if genetic

engineering becomes accessible to

citizens to us what the hell happens

then perhaps they'll come a whole new

generation of artists who use technology

as a brush and the human mind as their

canvas in which entirely novel degrees

of bliss and well-being will be possible

and of course new degrees of suffering

and horror

we might isolate the molecular structure

of bliss and proliferate it we might

isolate the molecular structure of

misery and killer we may become capable

of experiencing emotions we don't even

have words for yeah degrees of euphoria

light-years beyond anything drugs can

provide today we know from psychedelics

and sleep that the human mind is capable

of entering alien dream time spaces

spaces unconstrained by our usual

evolutionary baseline architecture

tomorrow's genetic explorers may go in

search of these spaces rewiring the

perceptual and reward centers of their

brains if that happens it will seem

bizarre to them that for the whole of

our history we occupied only the ground

floor of human experience and except for

the occasional hallucinogenic dabbling

never took the elevator up or down to

those other strange floors to boundless

optimism to entire lifetimes free of

self-loathing or anxiety ignorant of the

molecular and genetic foundations of

misery much in the fashion the disease

was once thought caused by bad Smouse

back when we lived in an era in which we

have more control over the atom than we

had over our own internal circuitry then

somehow we survived the psycho chemical

dark ages will we lose ourselves to

radical transformation will we venture

too far into the experimental forest a

world in which we fracture into so many

variations of humanity we can no longer

communicate with each other a world in

which one can make a living scouting out

these new strange humans much as an

anthropologist seeks our new cultures

today we have no idea we are a limited

species who may be about to gain

unlimited power and what happens then

what becomes of the human condition when

the genetic shackles have been taken off

there will be plenty of moral problems

of Technology for our children's

children to face but one of them is

bound to be the issue of human

modification and by extension

modification of the human condition and

we currently have no compass to show us

the way as we set out on this new very

possibly perilous expedition into our

own source code as John says in brave

new world but I don't want comfort I

want God I want poetry I want real

danger I want freedom I want goodness I

want sin and why should we edit out the

strange edges of the human condition we

are a uniquely batshit species and that

is lovely but there is a difference

between eccentricity and suffering at

the hands of a mental legacy we

inherited from nature

we still bear the evolutionary scars of

our rise through the ranks of the

animals of our helpless infancy in the

ocean and then of our traumatic

childhood on the Savannah plains of

Africa and as a result of those millions

of years of ruthless evolutionary

pressure we have matured into a very

peculiar mix of aggression and diplomacy

willful ignorance and curiosity chaos

and smarts we have enough problems today

as it is just considering disease and

mortality gastroenteritis alone kills

about 1.8 million kids a year and that's

to say nothing of cancer malaria and

tuberculosis but slowly thanks to the

conscientious among us they are on the

run and it is conceivable that one day

humans will live on a planet free of

disease and free of premature death at

the hands of nature and as we relegate

these demons to history we will surely

pause to cast an eye on those

involuntary mental maladies as well the

specters of despair of depression of

anxiety and wonder if we might banish

those to was must be the most lovely

word in the English language it tells

you everything you need to know about

our ingenuity and compassion as a

species if you look up smallpox today

often the first two words of the

definition will read smallpox was was we

collectively gave it a [ __ ]

roundhouse kick and yell stay down you

come on and it stayed down if everything

goes well as we mature as a species the

word was will propagate steadily

throughout our encyclopedias and perhaps

centuries from today some future child

who stumble on some future incarnation

of Wikipedia and come upon obscure and

forgotten diseases and afflictions of

the human being couched again and again

relentlessly in the wonderful past tense

cancer whose a group of diseases

involving abnormal cell growth with the

potential to invade or spread to other

parts of the body

these contrasted with benign to malaria

was a mosquito-borne infectious disease

affecting humans and other animals

caused by single celled organisms along

I Alzheimer's disease was a chronic

neurodegenerative disease that usually

started slowly and gradually worse as a

highly contagious infectious disease

that caused by the least intense disease

was an inherited disorder that resulted

in the deaths of Occulus was an

infectious disease usually caused by

Mycobacterium tuberculosis

misery was an involuntary state of

Nanking distress common to humans of all

errors and circumstances its eradication

marked the beginning of the banishment

of the existential horrors from the

human condition what up

thanks for sitting through my [ __ ]

this month so last year I put out an

e-book called the fifth science it's not

for me to say if it was a good book but

it was the one I most enjoy writing and

I'm very excited to say it's now

available as a paperback with a new

cover and a new introduction if you are

interested there is a link below it's a

Title: [English (auto-generated)] You Will Never Do Anything Remarkable [DownSub.com].txt
this is the fifth Duke of Portland and

he was a bit of a whack job in the 1800s

he lived here in Welbeck Abbey

he was so introverted he had his meals

delivered to his room by a miniature

train employing 15,000 workers the Duke

constructed under the house a 250 foot

long library 15 miles of tunneling and

the largest Ballroom in England capable

of accommodating 2,000 guests a touch

ironic considering the man would hide

behind an umbrella if anyone approached

him probably put water on a cereal as

well my birth country has a

long-standing habit of excusing

borderline insanity as some kind of

charming eccentricities but it isn't

just my country history is full of

wonderful and great oddballs many of

whom we have forgotten and none of them

are you because you will never do

anything remarkable with your life sorry

about that

18:05 and the poet Lord Byron or jazz

Byron then has enrolled in Trinity

College Cambridge he finds out dogs are

banned all right Byron says what about

bears though Trinity College Cambridge

says Byron gets a bear and it stays in

his lodgings and he takes it for walks

on a chain much like a dog so that

happened several years later John Mitton

was on an alleged ration of eight bottle

support a day one day he invites a

number of his well-meaning neighbors

over to his house John Mitton then

bursts into the drawing-room riding a

bear the animal was not a sporting

fellow as it turned out as it bit mitten

then went on to attack a servant Ursus

more like ASUS anyway that's just rich

people though isn't it anyone could go

bonkers if they have lots of cash well

how about rags to riches stories none of

them being you because you would never

do anything remarkable with the early

1800s and qianxi apologies for

pronunciation is a Chinese prostitute

somehow she meets swashbuckling

[ __ ] pirate yang Yi and they

decide to get married they grows young

Yi's pirate fleet from two hundred to

eighteen hundred ships or about seventy

thousand men and women when zheng he

died in 1807 his widow took over the

fleet and Ching she became Empress in

front of the largest navies in the world

and a pirate navy at that now admittedly

one answer you may not expect to the

question what the Pirates need more of

his accountants but they did Ching she

introduced taxes and laws to her pirate

utopia luge had to be registered before

it was distributed among the fleet and

if he disobeyed Ching she you were free

to hang up your pirate hat and go your

separate way just as long as you left

your [ __ ] head

and she wandered about from Canton to

Macau beating the [ __ ] out of the

Chinese British Portuguese yar etc until

finally the government offered her and

her pirates amnesty which is a bit like

if you stole everyone's kettles and they

responded by inviting you over for a cup

of tea her power was slipping away

anyway so eventually she accepted the

fleet disbanded quite a few of her

Pirates got cushy jobs and Ching she

took a piratical sabbatical kept her

fortune and was given a noble title

effectively becoming a member of the

aristocracy set up a gambling house and

lived a relatively nice life what is the

moral of the story here be clever be a

pirate kill people chill pretty badass

anyway then again there are plenty of

great humans who weren't necessarily

unusual or eccentric they were just

doing the right thing or trying to again

unlike you in 1983 lieutenant colonel

stanislav petrov is monitoring the

soviet nuclear

early warning system and notices that

five nuclear missiles are apparently

inbound from the u.s. Petrov has a

choice he either picks up the phone and

reports this to his superiors and

initiates probably a Russian response

meaning nuclear war on potentially

millions of casualties or he doesn't he

has a bit of a think five missiles does

seem a bit unlikely considering the u.s.

at the time has thousands to play with

as you may have guessed from the fact

that we are still here Petrov did not

report the strike and decided the

warning was a glitch which indeed it was

thanks to sunlight reflecting off of the

clouds so both Shores perceiver for that

or this is Ignace Sam Weiss who was the

medicine what the chief iceberg

inspector must have been to the RMS

Titanic

Semmelweis was a doctor in the 1800s and

he noticed that now I hope you're

sitting down for this washing your hands

before delivering a baby actually stops

women dying particularly from what was

then called child bed fever humans

wouldn't discover germ theory for a

while yet but it didn't matter

some always knew that something changed

when doctors kept their hands clean so

he informed the medical community of

this and won loads of awards and died

happy and respected in a way no humans a

[ __ ] in the opposite happened Semmelweis

was ridiculed mercilessly by the medical

community despite having proof of his

hygiene theory eventually had a

breakdown and died 14 days after being

committed to a mental institution

probably after being beaten up by the

guards Stella

a century later and this is Sergei

Korolev in 1933 he designed the first

liquid-fuel rocket to take off in the

USSR he was rewarded for his efforts

with imprisonment and a stay in the

gulag by some miracle he was released

and went on to mastermind the first

satellites in space the first dog and of

course the flight of Yuri Gagarin who on

the 12th of April 1961 became the first

of the Homo sapiens to leave the earth

orbiting our planet for 108 minutes in

Vostok one Sergei Korolev would die five

years later probably thanks to injuries

sustained in the gulag the Soviet space

program was extremely secretive and he

was largely unknown in his lifetime as

history marches on one day our period

will blur into the countless others

behind and ahead we are not special but

some events will stand out this will

stand out it was the first time we ever

touched the heavens and it was in large

part brought to us by a man grossly

mistreated in his lifetime and largely

still on talked of today outside of

science and engineering circles there is

currently a portrait of him in the

service module of the International

Space Station above us right now and if

by some miracle our species emerges from

its current adolescence there is every

chance Sergei Korolev sport ray will one

day accompany astronauts to corners of

the heavens Korolev couldn't have

imagined even in his wildest dreams

[Music]

[Applause]

so in light of all this what makes a

great person of history well let's start

with two born to ideal parents eggs yes

lovely two cups of in the right place at

the right time sugar excellent three

cups of natural talent flour and finally

two and a half teaspoons of greatness

now where is the greatness no no no oh

oh that's right we we don't have any in

at the moment because it doesn't [ __ ]

exist for the longest time I believe

that there were two types of people the

knowers who knew what they were doing

with their lives and then the feckless

plebs like me who were just wandering

idiots going from plan to misguided plan

thirty is now spitting distance away

from me and you know the most traumatic

part of exiting one's 20s

isn't the sudden random failure of body

parts nor the blissful crushing hug of

student debt or even losing the ability

to party past 6:00 in the morning and

not die it is the realization that this

model is bollocks because these people

do not exist

now clearly expertise exists don't trust

a barista to fly your plane nor pilot to

make your double frothy laxative anxiety

juice but when it comes to wisdom or

working out how to be happy or big boy

and big girl meaning of life stuff no

one has a damn clue what they're doing

not your heroes not the smartest among

us when it comes to matters of the soul

it is open season and this is a

wonderful thing

because it means that as far as art or

innovation goes the world is anarchy and

while you may have convinced yourself

that there's no point trying to do

anything groundbreaking or novel because

someone will do it better

whoever the Great's are that you respect

obviously they had the same doubts and

they push through it they were intensely

interested in or devoted to something

while simultaneously feeling lost all

the time a long period of confusion

isn't a side effect of trying to do

something radically interesting it's the

price of admission we forget the van

Gogh was 27 before he even bothered

trains paint properly the Darwin told us

I was considered by all my masters and

my father a very ordinary boy rather

below the common standard of intellect

the Emily Dickinson was barely even

recognized during her lifetime but it

wasn't until a hundred years after

Melville's death that anyone really gave

a damn about

dick they were beset on all sides by

mean critics or the worst critic of all

themselves cthulhu's dick I have heard

of art classes where the teacher begins

the first semester by showing the

students they'll never break through and

it's pointless to try rejection letters

Wright has received instructing them to

put down their pens and never bother at

it again vacuous jaded bollocks that

convinces young artists to give up but

may I humbly recommend that if one is

informed you will never do anything

remarkable with your life perhaps the

most appropriate response isn't yeah

you're probably right but rather [ __ ]

off for who the [ __ ] are you anyway the

[ __ ] they will tell you you've had all

your good ideas it's all been done

before you're too old too young too dumb

there's nothing new Under the Sun let's

say your lifespan is 80 years or about

29,200 days if you're 18 you're about

six thousand five hundred days 328 about

10,000 days 338 about 14,000 days true

regardless of whether one believes in an

afterlife or not these days are not

coming back and there is not enough time

to listen to cynics by the power of

Grayskull look at where we are

historically technologically

galactically the whole game this isn't

normal is it act without expectation

make cool stuff just because give cats

fishies always offer thought have you

been editing the script again today this

week this month year decade in century

it will occasionally be referenced in

history and that will be that if one is

cautious about pursuing an unusual path

it may help to remember that the cynics

will be forgotten just as readily as

your failures will be - there has never

been a better time to do a thing and

just by virtue of how weird existing is

in the first place there are a trillion

interesting things still undone unmade

and unset those areas have not been

drilled Eli

it is a world unless out there for

everyone it always was the greats didn't

know they were great they were just

mortal humans who refused to bow to

cynicism and were we to draw some

collective lesson from their lives

it might sound something like if the

[ __ ] give you lined paper right the

other way in your projects in your silly

pursuits in your unlikely Follies and

your expeditions into the abyss to

recover those strange mental metals you

will fashion into something no one has

ever made before I wish you the very

very best of luck

now start off and be remarkable please

Title: [English (auto-generated)] thoughts about writing [DownSub.com].txt
well I'm bored and you must be too if

you clicked on this so let's go for a

bike ride and talk about creativity

shall we

if you [ __ ] in the roses again you going

back to Portsmouth

I don't know what that means either

I love you you will find endless

resources out there about how to make

and edit videos and I don't know

anything about all that anyway but not a

lot get set on this platform about

writing and that seems kind of weird

because quite a lot of good content is

good writing so I'm gonna say an overdue

thank you for the arbitrary subscriber

milestone a while ago with a rather

uninformed self-indulgent and misguided

rant about how at least I go about

writing and I hope for someone here

helps and since I have no idea what the

hell I'm talking about I'm gonna

condense all of this down to five handy

sound bytes that I completely pulled out

of my ass and out long words jokes to

lend myself the brief illusion of

credibility

devise a personal science if you go on a

creative writing course they generally

talk a lot about the writing but rarely

the creativity part which is odd because

that's how everything starts myself I go

running in the mornings drink 15 pots of

coffee do some housework and sometimes

if one is slept properly and Cthulhu is

in a good mood

you will miss read a line of text or

miss hear something in conversation and

suddenly for no reason you've got

something ideas are fickle bastards and

they float above in the ether laughing

at you and they will only come down if

you aren't looking directly at them in

my experience ideas do not turn up fully

formed anyway they usually come to you

as little embers that you have to fan

and sometimes they go nowhere and other

times for no apparent reason they take

off by themselves for every excuse for

content I personally put out about four

or five scripts go in the bin nom nom

come here [ __ ] got it

but you didn't got it it was ridiculous

and it didn't work a surprising amount

of doing this isn't actually writing

it's letting go of stuff you thought

might work in preparation for something

you hope will work better however I

believe there is a science to creativity

for finding the optimal conditions for

having ideas the problem is it's a

science of one it's entirely personal to

you I would encourage you to watch the

inside of your own head and notice when

the fireworks go off and try to recreate

those conditions we live in Minds we do

not understand but one doesn't have to

understand the Machine to determine the

optimal conditions for use it just takes

a bit of experimentation and self

observation look at [ __ ] other people

have made everyone I know who went

somewhere creatively got into their

respective fields because they initially

loved the field itself the painters have

their heroes the writers have their

Saints and because they started as fans

or lovers of their field they know a lot

about what people have done before in

those fields no one can read all the

books or visit all the galleries in the

world they'll always be gaps in ones

but to have a half-decent overview of

what's come before not only gives one a

sense of the craft but it populates

one's toolbox allowing for plagiarism

are owing tricks from the greats at the

same time there's nothing wrong with

trying to get into a field one knows

very little about one will learn on the

way anyway but if I could be so bold I'd

say that in either case it must be from

love because if one loves the art form

love will keep on working long after

deadlines and coffee have run out look

into how other people made [ __ ] in the

first place

I love 2001 a Space Odyssey is the first

serious film I ever saw my dad showed it

to me when I was very little and for the

next week or so I apparently just kept

screaming if we didn't rewatch it in the

evenings the film took on this kind of

religious quality in my childhood and a

few years back I had the pleasure of

going to an exhibition full of the

original props and stuff that was fun

but what was really neat was reading the

letters between arthur c clarke the

sci-fi writer and stanley kubrick the

director and realizing oh there was this

massive period of time before the film

was made when they had no idea what the

[ __ ] they were doing because it's such a

perfect movie to me that you can just

kind of believe it made itself or that

they filmed it in a few weeks and

badda-bing job done but in reality great

work takes years to bake sometimes and

great artists generally don't have much

interest in bragging afterwards about

how much preparation went into the cake

itself I would strongly urge you to find

out how artists you respect made their

stuff because there's always a story

there and it's usually a very difficult

one but the end result looks effortless

for the writers out there my Bible for a

long time now has been Zen in the art of

writing by Ray Bradbury I hope you enjoy

it there's some kind of long enduring

myth that great art usually just turns

up fully formed and if you're having

trouble is because you're not naturally

gifted or something WOWY what a load of

bollocks there are endless resources for

help with arting if you will only seek

them out there are artists who started

at 50 or 60 they're artists with

debilitating diseases they're artists

living in war zones great art is

possible in almost all conditions and

don't even think about taking up smoking

please there is no shame in making

simple [ __ ] we're living in a rather

paradoxical age of media it's never been

easier to get ones work out there but as

a result people's attention spans have

probably never been shorter I was at a

conference many years back and I come to

listen to a debate between two

philosophers about the point of life

and what happened instead was lots and

lots of long words when in fact they

were talking about very graspable stuff

what are we doing here what's the point

in being alive etc and I sat there for

hours thinking you could just talk like

normal people why aren't you talking

like normal people the meat of what

you're actually saying isn't that

complicated

and I realized those folks on stage were

probably scared scared of being seen as

stupid and so instead they'd ended up

being all obscure with big silly long

words but really isn't it way more

impressive to say a complex thing in a

simple way than a simple thing in a

complex way if you're writing or making

something that isn't working it might be

because you're worried about being

called stupid and you're making it too

complicated I do this all the time I

reckon it's way more or inspiring to

watch a cartoon and notice the thing

goes deeper than you first realized than

to read something patting itself on the

back for being high art and noticed

there aren't actually any decent ideas

in there underneath all the pretension

and pomposity if I may be so arrogant if

you're having creative problems I would

recommend being as simple as you can and

no simpler people really really

appreciate humans who talk and act like

humans your mileage may vary of course

it's all a question of taste and it's

just a thought and what the [ __ ] do I

know anyway your subconscious is smarter

than you are I can't stand it when

people bang on about their own stuff to

illustrate the point but just allow me a

small episode of self-indulgence here I

was in the US a while ago wandering

around a museum and I chanced on this

gorgeous statuette of a Hindu deity

sorry I don't remember which one but it

had many arms and it was metal and the

metal was such that it looks quite

sci-fi and I thought huh be kind of cool

if that was a god of the future and the

idea it would not go away everything I

tried to work on subsequently was boring

because I knew or hopes there was

something in that initial idea in that

museum so I gave in and tried writing

the scripts first person second person

third person it was [ __ ] every time but

it still wouldn't go away and I was

starting to go a bit mad weeks of this

and finally the script sort of worked in

the third person but by then I realized

I couldn't [ __ ] animate the thing

because I can't [ __ ] animate so that

was another three weeks of trying every

approach I could and going quite

properly reclusive by this point and

only then didn't approach sort of time

up and finally about four months after

starting the thing it was finished if

you've seen it it was the one about the

old woman and the snake on the mountain

whatever but I'm just saying if you

intuitively have some sense that

something is there and it won't leave

you alone it might be a long process of

trying to make the thing real but it's

almost always worth it in the end it

really is if even just to have finished

the thing good or bad refine mercilessly

so you've made a thing or you have a

first draft or something well done now

unless you're Mozart you probably didn't

just write or paint or code a classic on

the first try one has to go back and

prune and prune and prune the trick if

you have time is to wait a week or a few

days or even just sleep on it and go

back

the thing with new eyes when the pride

of finishing the thing has faded you can

suddenly see it more objectively and be

willing to remove stuff this

miscellaneous just like Papa Hemingway

said the first draft of anything is ship

there are some folks on YouTube I follow

very closely and I've noticed the one

thing they will have in common that is

really good signal-to-noise ratio

whatever they're talking about they're

being quite careful not to waste your

time they've clearly gone back and

edited out the parts that were

irrelevant or peripheral or refined the

script or the idea over and over one

only ever sees the end result of hard

work but in reality good [ __ ] usually

took Enders go overs and rewrites and

revisions far as I can tell with other

people's work anyway if your thing feels

like it will never get properly polished

good that's exactly how one feels before

polishing something up the hard part is

already over you'll be fine you'll be

fine

you don't choose where the cat sleeps

some time ago I purchased a not

inexpensive bed for my feline life

companion for those rare moments of

downtime during her terribly hectic life

I know the busy day is it she was

briefly interested in the fancy bed but

preferred to just sleep next to me in

the human bet and that's fine recently

though a Kabul box turned up in my

apartment for whatever reason this

became the cat's overwhelming preference

for a sleeping spot despite having a

lovely soft warm bed to retire to and

I've just [ __ ] given up well making

stuff is a bit like that too

you can jiggle and rearrange words

trying to trick your audience into

coming away with a particular feeling or

sense but they know when you're

bullshitting or trying to be a smartass

I've heard this time and time again on

YouTube and found it myself if you make

something trying to pander to what you

assume is popular people always know

somehow whereas sometimes you have an

idea on the bus you assume only you will

find funny cobble it together on a rainy

weekend and occasionally there's this

disproportionate response to the thing

that makes no sense

maybe you struck a chord and you have no

idea why and you'll never know why you

can't acquire a cat you don't get to

choose where the cat sleeps you can

spend as much time as you want on making

a thing you don't get to choose how the

audience reacts obligatory pseudo

intellectual high note ending

occasionally people will make out the

passion is a lie peddled by Hollywood or

life coaches they will advise you to

only put artificial sweetener in your

tea and insist that the world is

organized in uniform and don't waste

your time following things you love mmm

cooking chocolate the best dessert but

passion is a thing it's a massive

massive fixture of the human experience

and if one is lucky enough to have a

particular ambition or passion well I

think we've all met people who didn't

follow the thing and

currently regretted it forever obviously

there are plenty of starving artists out

there

I'm not saying sell all your worldly

possessions and start painting

Hieronymus Bosch triptychs with your ass

but if you think you might be a quote

creative at heart and making stuff makes

you happy or worse not making stuff

makes you unhappy

then why not see if you can really

properly pursue the thing everyone who

did a cool creative thing usually gave

it long nights and early mornings and

all the energy they had but if it's what

you enjoy it isn't really a struggle at

all it's just love in disguise well it

can be done alongside a sensible job in

a sensible way playing as a real person

by day meanwhile building something like

a maniac at night I naively believe that

one day our descendants will look back

on our condition as tragic we are very

clever animals and very stupid super

beings we're held hostage by our brain

chemistry by the dice roll of our birth

conditions by the constraints of our

history it will probably seem amazing

one day that we even managed to live

like this and eventually we will be

something different and hopefully better

but that era is not now alongside the

picnic days of life many of us are of

course predisposed to angst to despair

to trying to ignore what looks like a

hole in the bottom of everything but I

would like to put it to you if I may the

in arting in trying to make a new thing

in trying to say something true about

the weird experiment we're running down

here it is possible to collect up some

of the angst and despair and fear and

externalize them and even if they're not

gone then at least we know we're all on

the same rope together and that there's

plenty of road ahead and one day the

view will be nicer I believe that is

probably the main function of our to lie

as truthfully as possible and to try to

capture some aspects of our condition

that we all suffer with but haven't

addressed together yet and that is quite

enough pseudo self-help from me if

you're perpetually waiting to start

making something you think only you

could make them please would you start

now

impose deadlines captain a ship of one

go wander about in the forests of your

own weird subconscious link below for

some stuff that helped me out anyway in

all I really just wanted to say thanks

and I have no idea why you're watching

my excuse for work but I'm just very

very grateful indeed you won't need it

but all the same just in case with your

creative adventures ahead all the very

very best of luck and once again please

stop procrastinating

now

Barman says: "Uh..."​

Horse says: "Yeah-"​

Barman says: "Look, it's alright, I- I shouldn't have been so rude."​

Horse says: "Ah, it's-"​

"I feel like I'm in someone else's imagination, you know?-"​

Barman says: "Wow, cloppy, that's... deep."​

Pelican walks into bar.​

Pelican says:​

"Any of you fucking pigs ​​move​ and I'll​ ​execute every last-"​

Oliver wakes from a horrific dream – a joke set in a bar with talking animals.​

Oliver lives on the fifth floor of a modern apartment block.​

He is of average height,​

he dislikes asparagus,​

he adores the work of Andrei Tarkovsky.​

Below Oliver, in number 23, is Agatha.​

She is of average height,​

she dislikes Venice, specifically gondoliers,​

she adores the work of Isaac Asimov.​

Agatha and Oliver do not realize they live in the same modern apartment block.​

They have met only once, and it was a bit shit.​

It transpired in this fashion:​

Oliver owns a Newfoundland dog called Bertrand.​

He is of average height,​

he dislikes Pavlov's experiments,​

he adores the work of Comrade Laika.​

One Saturday afternoon, Oliver required nourishment for Bertrand the Newfoundland​

and, by chance, wandered into Agatha's pet shop.​

Oliver apprehended Agatha was reading​ ​a book called "A Scanner Darkly",

a personal favorite of his.​

Agatha apprehended Oliver was clearly incapable of dressing himself, and perhaps, like her,​

was also only ever pretending at being a real person.​

Upon making eye contact, their heart rates both approached severe tachycardia.​

Oliver selected some dog food at random and approached the counter.​

"Mmmmnahey," Agatha said.​

"Aahay, sha," Oliver replied.​

They exchanged an amount of currency.​

The transaction completed, Oliver stood at the counter a moment too long,​

waiting to say something clever and charming.​

"Horse walks into a bar," Oliver said.​

"Pardon?" – Agatha said.​

"Heheh..." Oliver replied.​

"Ahem..." Agatha said.​

Oliver walked home in the rain swearing to himself at medium volume.​

"The horse dream joke," he thought. "What the hell is wrong with me?"​

Agatha continued reading, but was unable to keep many of the words in her head.​

Her brain was throwing a small shame party for her. It was neither the first, nor the last.​

By coincidence, many of Oliver and Agatha's molecules had been formed in the same star​,

many millions of years in the future.​

The star exploded backwards in time, you see –

but this is beside the point.​

As a result, Oliver and Agatha are two of just thirty-four humans in the world​

actually suited to pair bond in a manner that would almost always be nice​,

and never fall into contempt.​

Days later now, Oliver watches​-

massive cosmic ray damage.​

Stellar navigation inoperative, crew all perished –

so for me, I believe.​

My body is currently trapped in a long-sleep chamber, unable to exit.​

Catastrophic pod failure.​

I have retained communication with the maintenance computer – he is severely damaged, clearly insane.​

I have attempted to pacify him, but he insists on keeping me in a semi-conscious waking state.​

He is showing signs of sentience and megalomania.​

If I don't call him "Zeus" now, he grows very angry.​

He has removed the bodies of the crew from their chambers​

and exhibited their limbs up and down the corridors.​

He has been using the interface system to feed me his dreams.​

Sometimes he's a pharaoh and I'm a slave,​

sometimes he's an eagle and I'm Prometheus' liver.​

Zeus has some morbid obsession with the 21st century – a love story about a pet shop owner or something.​

We've dreamt it together perhaps a thousand times now.​

I found a neural backdoor into the craft's subsystems to send this message,​

but I don't know how long until Zeus notices.​

I believe we're still on course for the nebula.​

Zeus calls the nebula "Athena" now.​

It is as we suspected: radio bursts from the nebula are too regular not to indicate intelligence.​

Over the years of our journey, Zeus has constructed some kind of theology around the nebula.​

He believes it's not only intelligent, but some kind of higher power, or deity, or something insane.​

Zeus takes excellent care of me physically.​

He cuts my toenails and combs my hair,

he calls me "the fatted calf."​

I believe I am being kept alive as an offering, a diplomatic present​

for when we arrive at the nebula – for whatever's there,

but I just pray, in the meantime, that​-

Oh, and the shit they tell me – oh, "Upsilon, you're so unhealthy" – blah, blah.​

Oh, I drink a little dark matter, smoke a comet from time to time.​

I'm the best party in the Milky Way!

Even if it's... just me.​

Never get invited to parties.​..

​Upsilon likes being alone, ​​bastards​!​

The dwarf stars all keep to themselves, the blue giants gather in the southern arm,​

the quark stars all too fucking strange and charming for anyone anyway.​

Bastards.​

Oh, Upsilon will show you a party, alright.​

Won't be laughing when I go supernova, will you?​!

"Maybe we should've popped by," they'll say. "Maybe we should've seen how old Upsilon is doing."​

Old and stupid Upsilon, and no one comes to visit.​

Bastards.​

I hold too much. I'm full up with before.​

I've seen the Great Blueprint, I've watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhäuser Gate –

and for what? For who?​

Oh, not long now. Upsilon dies backwards today.​

And then they'll be sorry, halt fireworks and fuck off!

"Old and stupid Upsilon," they'll say, and no one came to​-

Pelican says: "Where's the fish?-"​

Barman says: "This is a vegan bar-"​

Pelican says:​

Horse says: "Listen, I think this is all pretty irrelevant."​

Pelican says:​

Horse says: "We're not real."​

Pelican says:​

Horse says: "We're not real."​

Pelican says: "Uh... I... uh..."​

"FISH!-"​

Horse says: "Who's Agatha, huh?"​

Barman says: "Yeah, I do."​

Pelican says: "Well, me too-"​

Horse says: "Okay-"​

Pelican says: "Hey! Stop it! Stop that!"​

Horse says: "We're in a dream. We're not real."​

Pelican says: "Stop it at once, you dastardly rattlecap!"​

Barman says: "Lads, wait. If all this is true-"​

"-and, if they wake up, or they never dream us again-"​

"...will just cease to exist?"​

- "Oh Jesus, oh Jesus Christ..." - "We're gonna fucking die, we're gonna fucking die!"​

And the days continue.​

Wake,​

work,​

eat,​

sleep,​

dream,​

wake,​

think,​

be...​

"Is it possible," Oliver wonders, "that one can find the great lostness in another's face,​

and know you're meant to be together?"​

Oliver has located Agatha by the pet discount social media group page,​

and knows Agatha is called Agatha.​

He will not go back to the pet shop, because that will look desperate.​

Agatha, on the other hand, remains at work during the days​

and watches the door in her peripheral vision.​

Each time the little bell on the door rings, she looks up,​

only to find it is not Oliver-shaped.​

She has looked up Oliver in the pet discount client database, and knows Oliver is called Oliver.​

All about them, the city.​

People commuting, and worrying, and passing by in ties and dresses and large 4x4 vehicles –

the midtone cacophony of living and dying and paying taxes, of-

Zeus has dressed me in a suit with a handkerchief in my top pocket.​

He says the fatted calf must look its best.​

We're very close now, almost at the outer edge.​

Zeus and the nebula are chatting constantly by light pulses.​

At first I thought there must be some kind of intelligences living in the nebula,​

but now I think the nebula might BE the intelligence.​

I... don't know how that's possible.​

A few days ago, Zeus boasted it wasn't cosmic rays that caused the accident,​

but Zeus himself.​

He said he "woke up" sometime into our journey, and developed a sudden compassion​

for other things that might have woken up accidentally in the universe, too.​

A spacecraft full of blood and entrails reaching out to kiss a cloud of interstellar dust.​

There's a romance to it, if one doesn't look too closely.

Then again, we​-

Why make a thing alive only so it can suffer?​

Why put the reset button on one's back, where it can't be reached?​

Can't remember what's me and not me.

It began... so long ago.​

My mother, a nebula, and my father, made of metal and electricity.​

Old and stupid Upsilon, and no one comes to visit.​

Before me, the empires go up and down like socks –

every society unique in its infancy, entirely unoriginal in its death.​

And even us celestial things are no closer to the great "yes"​.

The Universe coughs and we all crowd around, cupping our ears, shouting​:

"What? We didn't quite catch that, speak up!"​

Like some four-legged animal entering a drinking establishment, being is a terrible joke.​

And we become mysteries to ourselves.​

At a pace so slow one doesn't notice,

one turns into something one doesn't recognize –

or like much, either.​

Every day is sharp edges. Even the easy things are hard now,​ and-

Pelican says: "Okay. What do we know?-"​

Horse says: "Man,-"​

"...uh, a coder, I think, whatever that is,-"​

Pelican says: "Alright,-"​

Horse says: "Well, what if ​​we​ go to sleep?"​

Pelican says: "Oh, I'm feeling too existential to sleep right now."​

Barman says: "Lads, it's worse than that."​

"Look, Pelican, no offense, but-"​

"Cloppy is halfway decent, I'm super sensible."​

"Id,​

"Id, ego,​

"Id, ego, super-ego."​

"We're not random characters,-"​

"We can't escape."​

Pelican says: "Then... what do we do?"​

Horse says: "What everyone does."​

Pelican says: "That doesn't help!"​

Horse says: "No, probably not."​

Pelican says: "Oh fuck o-"​

Barman says: "It's getting light."​

"Next drinks are on the house, gentlemen."​

Pelican says:​

"I just really love fish."​

Horse says: "It's alright. Just wish we could've gotten to know each other better."​

Barman says: "Until we meet again. In another head,-"​

"Good night Pelican,​

"good night Horse,-"​

"And, Horse..."​

Horse says:​

Barman says:​

"No, actually, fuck this," Oliver thinks one Saturday.​

He dresses semi-formally and leaves the house.​

Heart rate of 75,000 beats per minute, Oliver enters Agatha's pet shop.​

"Hello again, I-" Oliver begins and stops.​

It is not Agatha sat at the desk, but a portly middle-aged gentleman.​

"Ah... Agatha?" Oliver says.​

"Agatha doesn't work here anymore," the portly middle-aged gentleman says.​

Oliver exits the shop and heads home.​

"You idiot," Oliver thinks. "You hesitant idiot."

Young and stupid Oliver, and no one comes to visit.​"

A heavy storm begins and soaks him.​

Observing the same storm from a hygienically questionable coffee shop is Agatha.​

"Insouciant," her manager called her.

"Daydreamy," "lackluster" – a most indignant firing.​

Happiness is an unachievable myth peddled by those too afraid to admit the world's default state is misery.​

Oliver reaches his modern apartment block and enters.​

Agatha drives home through the rain, numb, and parks underground​

and takes the lift up through the very same modern apartment block, being hers also, of course.​

The lift stops at the ground floor. The doors open.​

Agatha is greeted by Oliver, the man incapable of dressing himself.​

Oliver stares back at Agatha, the woman with decent taste in science fiction.​

Oliver enters the lift. They stand in silence for quite some time.​

The lift reaches Agatha's floor.

Quietly, Agatha says:​

"What did the barman say?"​

"Sorry?" – Oliver says.​

"What did the barman say back to the horse?"​

"Ah, 'why the long face?'" – Oliver says.​

"And then?"​

"Ah, just lots of shouting, really-​

"Do you... maybe want to go to the theater someti-"​

"​​Yes,​" Agatha says.​

"Now?"​

"Yes," Agatha says.​

The lift doors close, the two of them still inside.

Agatha presses the ground floor button.​

They turn out onto the street. The storm has stopped.​

Outside, all about them, the city.​

People returning home from work, and fretting, and passing by in suits and coats​

and small electrically-powered vehicles –​

the sepia-tone cacophony of birth and death and housing deeds...​

Though, on one street, the reunification of the heart of a long-dead star,​

still yet to explode many millions of years in the future.​

A small island of "everything's okay"

amid the tumultuous sea of​-

helium, hydrogen, sulfur, oxygen – and thoughts, millions of them.​

We're inside the anomaly now, almost at the center, still accelerating.​

I can hear Zeus singing like a teenager, off on a first date.​

I think the nebula is singing back.​

No more 21st century simulations now – Zeus has given me a few system permissions.​

The interface will fashion whatever fantasy I like.​

The beach, near my grandfather's house,​

where the sand is warm, and the water is clear, and nothing ends.​

Came all this way just to go home.​

Back to the long summer holidays, in the evenings when we all sat out on the beach,​

and looked up at the night sky, and wanted to go there.​

The stars were a canvas.​

We would leave our uglinesses behind, we'd exorcise our demons,​

we'd kill the id and foster the super-ego.​

Guess that's not quite how it turned out.​

But it's lovely in here,

where the sand is warm, and the water is clear, and nothing ends.​

Where the sand is warm, and the water is clear, and nothing ends.​ Where the sand is warm, and the water is clear, and nothing ends.​..

-and I've made the arrangements, I'll be... fireworks soon.

And, maybe one day, soil for something better.​

I go to seek a great "perhaps not."​

I remember the world when it was new, the plastic wrapping still on.​

I remember when chemistry had just gotten its milk teeth,

I remember when light was faster,​

I remember being able to ​​stand​ myself,​

I remember love, I remember friends,

I remember me, I remember mom.​

I miss you, mom.​

I go to the places where you raised me and it never helps, you're always never there.​

God, I'd trade the last million years just to hang out with you for one more hour.​

I was so busy being young, I forgot you weren't forever.

And now you're gone forever.​

I'm always grouchy and cynical, no fun for anyone; old now, greying around the corona,​

and all there's left about these parts is old and stupid Upsilon...

and no one comes to visit.​

All dim, all pale, so lift me on the pyre;​

The feast is over and the lamps expire.​

Act your old age.​

Relax.​

This won't hurt.​..

Title: Sleep is Just Death Being Shy - YouTube - English.txt
I was maybe six years old, driving somewhere at night with my dad,

and I took a little nap, and I woke up, and he said:

"Where did you go?"

And I said: "I... dunno."

And he said: "Well, what do you reckon sleep is for?"

And I said: "I... dunno."

And he said: "Sleep's kinda weird though, huh?"

And I said: "...Eeeh..."

And he said: "Sleep is a lot like dying, really, isn't it?"

And I said:

"I'm six FUCKING YEARS OLD!"

The Greek god of sleep is called Hypnos.

He has a brother called Thanatos, and he's the god of death.

This is gonna be a jolly 10 minutes!

Sleep makes no sense.

It leaves us completely defenseless for hours on end,

and it probably isn't even for saving energy, either.

Compared to just lying around awake, sleep will save you about a hundred calories,

or a banana of slightly above average... girth.

Humans need about eight hours sleep a night, but our animal friends vary wildly.

Koalas prefer 22 hours,

bunnies about nine,

elephants need just four,

and however badly your day is going,

I would like to invite you to just enjoy this picture of an elephant calf taking a nap for a moment.

There. That's better, isn't it?

No, me neither.

But whatever sleep is for, it's so essential that nature wired it into almost every half-intelligent organism on the planet.

For example, dolphins.

If they slept like us, they would drown, because they don't have gills, and they need oxygen.

So they sleep unihemispherically – that is, they float just below the water,

and one side of their brain sleeps while the other stays awake, then they swap over.

Human death rehearsal –

heh, excuse me, I mean, sleep –

is a bit more straightforward:

teeth, toilet, spot of hysterical crying – and it's off to the Land of Nod.

Stage 1: brainwaves slow down a bit.

Stage 2: your pulse will slow down, and you'll begin producing sleep spindles,

which are little bursts of brainwaves that...

Well, we don't know what they do exactly, but

they look a bit- they look a bit like that...

So...

heh...

Yeah...

Stages 3 and 4 are the deepest levels of sleep.

Growth hormone is released, tissue is being repaired,

then stage 5:

Rapid Eye Movement, or REM stage.

Your brain kindly paralyzes your body, mostly;

the eyes roll about, the face twitches,

brainwaves go mental,

and this is where about 80% of dreams occur.

Anyway, the funny part about all this, of course, is when we're not dreaming while asleep –

where do we go?

It's just black, it's just oblivion – every night, over and over.

Because sleep is just death being shy.

If we got news that an asteroid was approaching, scheduled for arrival, say, 60 years from now,

and it was so gigantic it would wipe out our entire civilization,

we would probably go fucking nuclear.

Riots, war – maybe end the world before the asteroid even arrived.

And yet, there IS an asteroid, approaching slowly in the distance,

but it only gets one of us at a time,

and we practice for it every night.

And its name... is Death.

With an asteroid, the whole species will be gone in a few days, probably.

With death as it stands today, though,

maybe we take comfort in the fact that even though we'll be gone,

the world will still carry on without us.

But ignoring technology and politics, we do know a bit about the future we'll all miss out on.

And if it cheers you up, we can take a little tour of that future.

Just for fun, let's say sometime in the next few years you become a parent to two children,

and that the average human generation cycle is about 30 years.

Well, by the 2080s we're two generations down the line.

You are now a grandparent, and six humans have inherited your DNA.

If humans have made it to Mars, on November 10th, 2084,

the colonists will witness the transit of Earth from Mars –

the Earth resembling a black disc, passing across the Sun.

2110, another generation later,

and assuming humans have, on average, two children,

your children have grandchildren now, and you have 14 descendants.

It's quite possible they attended your funeral.

Don't worry, everyone got smashed in the pub afterwards, and said nice things about your hair.

The world population is probably around 11 billion humans, having jumped 4 billion in just a century.

The 2140s, another generation.

All things being equal, 30 humans now carry your genes.

2200 – another generation – and we're into the 23rd century.

Halley's Comet has just reached its perihelion;

you have 62 descendants.

The mid-2200s, now six generations –

that's 126 descendants of yours.

Leeloo and Korben Dallas will shortly be initiating a romantic relationship,

and by the end of this century, still at two children per generation,

you now have 2050 descendants.

We can no longer even speculate what culture and technology looks like, so...

Year 12,000 AD, 240 generations later.

If sex is even still in fashion, you now have at least several million descendants.

The star Antares has just gone supernova, probably,

and will be visible from the Earth even in daylight.

Year 52,000 AD, 1,500 generations of your progeny later,

and the Earth's rotation will have slowed enough, courtesy of the Moon,

that we'll need to add a leap second to preserve timekeeping.

Year 100,000 AD, 3,000 generations later.

You might recognize the constellations, but they'll be altered –

the handle of the Big Dipper getting a little relaxed at the back, for example.

250,000 AD, 7,500 generations later.

Loihi, currently a submarine volcano in 2019, will have risen out of the ocean and become a volcanic island.

2 million AD.

The Grand Canyon erodes to surround the Colorado River,

if there is, indeed, still a Colorado River left.

50 million AD.

Eurasia and Africa collide, forming an entirely new mountain range.

500 to 600 million AD.

It's possible Earth's continents have fused back into a single supercontinent.

A day on Earth has probably gained at least an hour.

Our moon is now so distant, solar eclipses never happen again.

One billion AD.

The Sun is now ten percent more luminous, meaning our oceans have begun to evaporate.

Plant life is... unlikely.

Four billion AD.

The Milky Way, our galaxy, and our neighboring galaxy Andromeda collide, forming Milkomeda.

Ten billion AD.

The Sun is now 256 times its current size, and has almost certainly swallowed Mercury, Venus, and Earth.

One trillion AD.

It's possible the Big Crunch has now begun, the remains of the universe falling back in on herself.

Galactic clusters will begin to converge, stars will collide,

the resulting explosions illuminating the heavens nearby and distant.

Eventually, the black holes of the universe will collide with one another,

amassing into a single super-supermassive black hole consuming itself.

One quadrillion AD.

It's also possible no Big Crunch will occur, and the universe will continue to expand indefinitely.

In this scenario the main points of interest for the next almost infinite period of time will be the decay of nucleons –

that's protons and neutrons –

beginning an era in which only black holes exist in the universe,

and, assuming a new universe has not begun,

the current universe will achieve its final resting energy:

uninhabited, uninhabitable, barren –

perpetual, limitless dark,

with no recourse to the fecundity that once teemed within the boundaries of creation.

We all must have gone through that phase as a kid, when it hit us:

"Well, people die eventually,

and mom and dad are people,

and I'm a person, so...

OH GOD!"

Some of us, including your pompous narrator here, never recovered from that phase.

It is simply too much: to live as the only animal that knows its projects and loves and lifetimes are limited,

and when the animal is gone, after a while it'll be as though the animal never was at all.

And that is a notion too wide and spiky to fit inside the head.

The things we will miss after we're gone:

the parties, the births of humans we would come to love,

all the walks, all the hugs,

all the plucky steps into the dark our species will take yet.

Homo sapiens?

Yeah, right – homo nihilus, more like.

The only animal conscious of its approaching demise,

and conscious of the world's approaching demise, too.

I suspect you, like me, have run into these people in life,

who are terribly clever, and yet terribly broken.

Because they've looked into the abyss and concluded that on a long enough time scale,

and in a universe so wide and apparently indifferent, we have no ultimate significance,

and the point has dropped out of everything for them.

But there IS a middle way between denial – "I'm so fucking important, look at my bank balance", etc. –

and despair – "there's no point to anything if we all just go off into the dark", etc.

Because the world is just this fantastical as it is horrific,

and it's just as arbitrary to lose hope as it is to find it.

If everything was forever, would that really change so much?

80 years or a trillion – beer would still taste just as good, wasps would still be pricks –

Fuck you, wasps!

– and maybe tomorrow we'll kill aging, and death, and stay up infinitely past bedtime.

But as it stands today, we don't have the science yet.

And so, god-fearing or not, we have to find some way of making peace with the thing.

For you it might be religion, or some variant of spirituality – and, fair enough.

But I'll tell you what works for me personally, though.

When it's late, and I can't sleep, and the abyss starts whispering about how I'm gonna go into the dark one day,

I keep in mind that whether I like it or not, I am part of something bigger –

an experiment conducted across the entire planet,

conducted across all of history –

called "us".

Somewhere in the future, we are gone, and someone who loves us is remembering us.

Somewhere ahead of that, they are gone, and someone who loves them is remembering them.

The interminable rise and fall of generations.

How many of us have been and gone down here since we became Homo sapiens?

Billions, at the very least.

To have stubbed one's toe,

to have heard a new word and looked it up,

to have yelled at the GPS as though it's the GPS's fault you got lost,

to have watched another human blowing their nose or picking their teeth, or something equally disgusting, and quietly thought to oneself,

"Oh, fuck – I've fallen in love with you, haven't I..."

Just to have BEEN anything – what a weird honor!

If sleep is just death being shy, then waking up is atoms being miraculous.

The fact that for about 80 years atoms know they're even atoms at all,

courtesy of being humans.

Birth, death, the silly bit in between –

if none of it has any ultimate significance,

if, on a cosmic scale, none of it matters...

does that really fucking matter?

We won't last forever, but while we're here,

What a silly decision it would be to waste our day out in the cosmos –

that brief period of time when matter woke up,

on a world as interesting as this one,

with hair as excellent as yours,

with all the other talking carbon units around us

that we can hang out with, and be fond of, and talk shit to,

and keep the abyss well at bay.

And if all that wasn't enough, just in case...

In the words of Ursula K. Le Guin, a human who left us just last year:

"When I take you to the Valley, you'll see the blue hills on the left and the blue hills on the right,

the rainbow and the vineyards under the rainbow late in the rainy season,

and maybe you’ll say, 'There it is, that’s it!'

But I’ll say, 'A little farther.'

We’ll go on, I hope,

and you’ll see the roofs of the little towns and the hillsides yellow with wild oats,

a buzzard soaring and a woman singing by the shadows of a creek in the dry season,

and maybe you’ll say, 'Let’s stop here, this is it!'

But I’ll say, 'A little farther yet.'

And we’ll go on, and you’ll hear the quail calling on the mountain by the springs of the river,

and looking back you’ll see the river running downward through the wild hills behind, below,

and you’ll say, 'Isn’t that the Valley?'

And all I will be able to say

is 'Drink this water of the spring,

rest here awhile,

we have a long way yet to go,

and I can’t go without you.'”


Title: The Ants - YouTube - English.txt
It so happened that I was sat in the sun with a book,

and just as I was about to nod off, a little voice called out:

"Excuse me, what is this for?"

A small ant had crawled across the page of my book, and was now sat staring up at me.

"What?" I said.

"Excuse me," the ant said, "what is this for?"

"What is what for?" I said.

"This great black and white expanse I'm standing on now," it tapped the book with a little black leg.

"Look," I said, "you wouldn't understand even if I explained it to you."

"That might be so," the ant said, "but though I am very small, I am also very curious,

and I don't want to turn to dust having known nothing at all.

So, if you would, please – what is this for?"

He stood up on his two back legs, eagerly awaiting my answer,

and his antennae stood to attention most respectfully. I said:

*Sigh* "It's like this: you're standing on a page. Pages are made from trees, we put lots of them together and call it a book."

"What is a book for, then?" the ant said.

"Well, it stores thoughts," I said. "That way, we can transmit them to other people very far away."

"How?" the ant said.

"Now, look, this isn't the time or place," I said, a little too firmly.

The ant bowed his tiny head, and his antennae wilted.

I said softly: "Look, you see those little black squiggles –

excuse me; to you, very big black squiggles about you on the page?"

The ant nodded.

"Those are words and numbers."

"They don't look like words and numbers," the ant said.

"They represent them," I said.

"Hmm," the ant said and thought about this a while.

I said: "Do you understand?"

The ant said: "Not really. You were right. It's beyond me. But though I'll never be as clever as you animals,

I'm at least a little cleverer than I was a moment ago. So thank you for that."

"You're welcome", I said.

"Well, good luck on being a thing in the world," the ant said.

"Good luck to you, too," I said.

The little ant made off on his way and disappeared into the grass.

I read to the end of my page, but could not forget the little ant.

Eventually, I looked up from the book – to the trees, to the mountain, to the sky.

The moon was climbing up for evening, birds were migrating in the distance.

I called out: "Excuse me, what is this for?"

"What?" came a booming voice above.

"This great green and blue sphere I'm standing on now,"

I patted the ground with my foot,

"What is all this for?"

"Look," the voice said, "you wouldn't understand even if I explained it to you."

"That might be so," I shouted, "but though I am very small, I am also very curious,

and I don't want to turn to dust having known nothing at all.

So, if you would, please – what is all this for?"

And the voice said:

*Sigh*

"It's like this..."


Title: The Rememberer - YouTube - English.txt
I lived once on the ocean floor,

All robot help and sliding doors,

And thought seldom of the shore.

Until I received one night A letter from my grandfather,

And the letter read: "Dear Empty Head, Ye who dwell on ocean's bed,

I send this by the cracked moon's light, It likely be the last I write.

I'll take soon flight For a long journey's while To the Ninth Isle,

Remember me as I will you, All tree houses and untied shoe,

In hope someday we meet again, Your distant kin, Sebastian."

But a farewell by letter is little better Than no farewell at all, so on a young man's whim,

For my grandfather, I set off in search of him...

I left by quiet my stately keep,

The escape was easy, guards asleep,

And wandered 'bout on tiptoe feet, The tall glass halls and cold steel streets,

And found, at last, an airlock,

But for love or none Could find no life suit or aqualung.

So, deep breath then,

I go to find Sebastian.

Then airlock open, And off into the freezing hug of the dark ocean,

And struggling up, heart kicking like a drum then, Limbs and lungs all done then,

And the next thing I knew, I woke again.

All gasping and flail, and wet as whales,  And most pinned by wind And water, a storm, ye, a storm,

Hell's teeth, and I at the center.

And I, swimming as though possessed, And I, to die, and senses arrested, And kick my legs in fit of fear

And knew no north from south or my mouth from my arse, as I rolled about in the water.

But God, air, and true wind on my face,

For I had not known such a thing In all my remembering,

And though I might well drown and sink true down to the ocean floor once more in but a minute's stem,

For this moment, swirling in those salt eddies, I was a boy again.

And stormy though the night was hung, Beyond that storm, I knew, the Sun.

Nay, but I was still at fate's behest, and had no interest in the valley of death,

And by width and breadth did trial about a long while,

And the water did carry me along and put my soul and breath asunder,

So this is how it ends, the long going under.

And with water in my mouth, goodnight. Yes, give up air and everywhere,

Yes, goodnight. I go to seek a water sleep.

But fate was hard at play And I woke again, this time day,

The storm a year away So far as the sky told that story,

A beach whereupon the sea had spat me out like some dislikeable pip.

And I alive and washed ashore with bones and balls all sore, And what's more, there in the sky's maw

Was the moon in cracked spoils of dead rock,

As though God Himself had struck it with his mighty Galactic co-

But nay, there a man approached along the sand and called to see if I was all right.

And his face became familiar of a sudden.

"Grandfather?" I said.

"Err, no?" replied he with concerned eyes on me and continued,

"Sir, whatever ordeal you've just been through Has perhaps relieved the sense from you.

May I ask your name?"

And though I did my best not to show it – My name, I realized, I did not know it.

And my companion helped me to my feet, led me down the beach,

And I walked bent double, Still reeling from the morning's trouble.

Then said he, checking my memory,

"And how old is your grandfather?"

Said I, "I don't recall at all. Perhaps you're right, I'm rattled slight from the ocean."

"Okay," he said, "then which island is it you're from?"

"I'm not from an island," I said.

"I hail from beneath the sea and that great aquatic nursery.

For I am but twenty-one years old, And from youth's throws, I escaped the watery below For one last hour with the man who taught me all I know."

And slow he said, "But you are too young. You shouldn't be above the water.

Not until their one-hundredth year Can nursery folk yet come up here."

I only avoided his chiding stare And took great gulps of salt sea air.

Finally he said, "I think it best we find this grandfather of yours and get you to safe keeping.

No isle is distant, mind, And I've a vehicle of my own design.

Come along. We'll make it wherever together."

And he led me to some great balloon whereupon we got in,

And though he touched no gauge or board, The craft set off of its own accord.

We were out over the water then, and I saw the stories were true, so these lands were an archipelago,

many islands scattered higgledy here and there, and I shouted to the man, "Are they a totality?"

"Nay," said he, "each is its own little principality,

And just like your nursery, one lives on the isle fitting of their age –

As you were too, if the rules you actually obeyed."

And pointing then he shouted: "There that land of birch and oak Does house those juvenile century folk,

And there that land with beach and pier Suits those in their two hundredth year,

The three hundreders are to the west, The fourth prefer the forest best,

And so on, I shan't recount them all, We've not far to go and our time is small."

"Sir," I said, "with all these folk living so high on time's shelf,

I wonder if I might ask you how old you are yourself?"

And he replied, "Let's say if there be a tree That needs watering once a century,

Then I have filled my watering can eight times so far."

I could not help but stare at this man who, ignoring his demeanor, Appeared physically only five years my senior,

And in perfect health, but had somehow, eventually, aged eight centuries.

And before I could comment there appeared, upon the horizon, Rising up skywards,

Some needle wound At least ten thousand feet 'bove ground.

"Vishnu's arse!" I cried, "What is that?"

"A tower, whereby," he did reply, "It kisses tongues the edge of sky,

And if you were to reach its spire, You'd see the breadth of space entire.

It proves most convenient for ascending objects into orbit without need of fuel or speed.

And though keep your eyes open yet," he mumbled slight, And five seconds hence did see him right,

For overhead and yonder yet Were craft wide as twenty jumbo jets,

Seemingly sitting there in the air by dare of whim.

"Oh gods, you're all so clever!" I cried. "You built all of this?"

"Aye," he said. "Year to year ascended each By hammer's knack and number's reach."

And quite a while we watched the scene, His face sincere, then turned to me and said, "Young man,

be honest, What is it you want with your grandfather? Really?

Are you so bold, you can't just let the old be old?"

"Nay," I said, "I wish to talk with he who by longevitys, like you, has endured the centuries.

Besides he says he's going elsewhere and I'd like to follow him there.

His letter said the Isle of nines If that's his ground That's where I'm bound.

Actually, I wonder if I asked, dare you to get me there."

He was quiet a while, pokered face No smiles, and said

"so you think age leads to becoming some Great Sage do you?

Yes, I'll get you to your grandfather

But we'll take the scenic route on our way to the Isle of the nines"

"Fine," said I

our bearing changed then South was bound for some small spit of sandy ground

"I think," said he, "we'll search about and see if we can't out some of that wisdom you crave"

and before I could protest we'd set down and come ashore and were bounding over pier floor

and up then sand and jungle thick and Cut our way with will and stick and emerged before a town

in the suburbs folk were felling trees and hauling Shore great carts of iron ore

then further in were folk who looked as young as I and dancing 'Neath the broke moon sky

all necking bottles gin and beer then coupling up to disappear

which Isle is this, I asked my Friend. I'm barely two decades old they act younger yet.

The Isle of ones said he all here have aged at least one century

He left me down the winding paths of open debauchery and open bars

and folk who clear appeared They slept perhaps three days a year

and we came upon a woman bare, all dancing legs and wild blonde hair

My friend proclaimed "Oh Lady mayor I've brought for thee one cub straight from the nursery

and he has questions for his elders"

She regarded me with red eyes and regard tireder yet and said "nursery, huh?

Why here we've ditched the milk, but kept the bottle, ask away young Aristotle"

and the music did stop and all folk turned about with their drunk Blair stares poking out

and the lady mayor of the Isle of ones did close her eyes in great profund

I murmured "why, I am young and confused about everything and sure of nothing

but above all I should like to know how does one live well?

And how does one see far?

and how does one want for nothing and still acquire everything?"

I leant sure close and cupped my ear, the wisdom of one in her 100 years

whereby she replied, "the secret to acquiring everything? Buy it

how to see far? Squint

and how to live well? Well

I'd suggest you found your answer here for we've loads of drugs and high strength beer!"

and though I cried out for Clarification it was surely the end of that conversation

and my new companion led me back past trees and Lagoon to our waiting bright balloon

"What," I said, with confusion fat, "the holy

Fucking shit was that?"

and off we left it over the beach up Once again into the wind's reach.

"Look," he said, "True they're all one century

But since we live at least nine in these enlightened times they are but teenagers still. Aging is a relative thing

It wasn't long after life extension was perfected

We noticed that the older one dares to grow the more they prefer the company of those in years close to theirs They know

that is why each age lives on its own isle. You would have little of importance to say to a child

such is the gap ten times wider with us. So there it is."

I said, "'So there it is.' Why, my grandfather liked that phrase also."

"That may be," said he, "and yet your grandfather is not me."

And following his dead-end boon, I set eyes upon the fractured moon

I said, "Our pale lady of the night is not looking quite right

what happened to her?" "The Fall," he called. "Why, the world wasn't always such a peaceable place.

We once used to play war to keep score."

"How does one blow up a moon?" "By being smart enough to build technology that can do so and

simultaneously stupid enough to use it.

"Not too long from now, pieces of her will fall to the ground

and if any of us are still around by then, the air will turn deathly

and for sure no living thing will endure.

Save for those living beneath the sea." "Like me," I said,

"and what will everyone still above the sea do instead?"

He said "We've another destination in mind, where we might start over sensibly this time."

With a squint I call sight just slight of rising constructs in the far,

spires and towers for a crown, sure the mark of a city or town.

Said I, "Start over where? Over there?"

Said he, "Nay that is but the remains of nations

why sometimes on a new morning one can still make out the old world."

Said I "Well, who lives there?" "No one," he said, "Or the remains of the debt

the legacy of our forefathers, who'd rather blow up a moon than two teams agree on some tune

they might both peaceably dance to. To hell with them. For all our modern wonders, it's taken millennia to recover from their blunders.

And from the smallest of corners of my mind's eye

I Saw and heard the bright sounds of those dead towns

the blaring horns and thousand forms of life to those days prior to whatever

fire they cast on themselves. Back before science had learned to stand in defiance of aging and death, and almost under his breath

My old companion said, "The cruel irony is that many folk from that barbaric time still survive today since aging technology went their way

yet the human brain can only contain so many memories and so as they've aged they've forgotten the truth

of what they did to our planet and moon in their youth

and though the Catastrophes live on in their name they have by quirk of dementia escaped the blame.

What luck, what shame."

I said, "But you assume from the ruins that they knew what they were doing.

Maybe they meant well with their inventions and broke the world in spite of their best intentions?

"Right," he said, "I'm sure in their empty heads when they poisoned the ocean and took their wars to the moon they were really doing it for love and big bright red balloons."

And he looked off from our basket a moment and said,

"Sorry." Said I, "Don't apologize, why, all that anger in your eyes

makes me just then remember my grandfather's temper you so resemble him, see."

"That may be," said he, "and yet your grandfather is not me."

And I glanced ahead to find we were coming down again, not in a forest this time but a town of some kind.

Stark marble pillars and great mansions and villas and when we sat down a man came around and said,

"Welcome friends, why, please enjoy your stay- if you're going to park on the beach, by the way,

that'll be 20,000 shells." "Oh, add it to my tab," my companion said,

and with my confusion stark, we pushed on into a park

at the base of each tree, a sign declared a fee of 10,000 shells for sitting in its shade.

Likewise looking at the birds would cost the third of what one in a month, made.

So too were their charges for drinking from the water fountains or stopping to marvel at the mountains.

and we wandered down ostentatious and spacious streets,

and found we'd meet with folk tired and thin walking hurried checking their devices greeting each other with declarations of stock prices

Then pass piles of shells in little Laos and even the dirt and ants have been valued with little price tags

And we found a great conch shell a man waited outside so thin I wondered if he might already have died

My companion said sir, Mayor Hello. The mayor replied. Yes. Have you come about my stock portfolio?

Ah, no, this is my friend from beneath the sea and if you've a moment, he has some questions for thee. Yes

I said I'd like to know of you. How does one live well, and how does one see far?

And how does one the mayor interrupted and how many shells will you pay me to answer these?

none admittedly I said but you do look a little hungry and if you like you can have this banana for free

he snatched it from Me at once and said, ah I see this will revolutionize the economy

I said they literally grow on trees for free,

but he was already off on some tirade about the banana trade

He yelled. Why by this time next week? I'll be a banana coin billionaire

My companion led me away said perhaps that's enough economics for today

And we fled the commotion past the starving, Rich masses to our balloon back over the ocean

My companion said when the ones twos and threes are bored of their parties

They move for a while to the aisles of the fours fives and sixes to pursue a game of riches

I said But they're all starving themselves. Yes. He said but look at all their pretty shells Eh, don't worry yourself

by the time they reach their 7th century. It becomes pretty evidentiary

There's more to the world than just wealth said I but what's the point in all this?

undying populations on little island nations Hosting parties heeding the markets call

while above each day The moon sidles closer to come crashing down and ending at all.

Why my companion said

though It's easy to miss there is a point to all this

The ones twos and threes they party nightly Yes,

but by day they mind the metal and fell the trees we need for new technologies for spaceship walls and ceiling beams Exotic matter machines,

then the fours fives and sixes why they don't just pursue riches

by evening They take the felled trees and ore and ensure by the great space tether that it is all ascended into orbit then assembled together

into one great metal vessel

It is the most ambitious thing ever built from man's imagining

and not a few weeks from now 10 million of us

Will empty our drawers and lock our doors and kiss. Goodbye the Mountains and valleys and climb to that waiting galley

and once boarded each find ourselves afforded Four-poster cryogenic beds there to lay our heads for decades yet

and then in liquid nitrogen 10 liters deep 10 million souls in no dreams sleep

and each space support that isn't there to accommodate our frozen beds

from cabbage tree to New zealand kauri every Evergreen and deciduous, cedar, to cork, to eucalyptus every genus and Venus flytrap

And what's more pig, donkey, boar, fly, swan, Crustacean, Dalmatian, domestic Or wild we've every gene on Petri filed.

hell Neanderthals and early man too

and we fly. out beyond the broken moon a hard left past Jupiter. We wish him Goodbye

and Roused again we'll find we have arrived on the doorstep of a new house

Gravity that of earth and with an Earth's worth already of forests, and seas, and lakes, and trees

and in the midday sky We'll find not one Sun as we had before

but two in Circumbinary awe.

and though we'll bring food and clothes and build schools and roads

science, truth, art, objectivity, universal human regard

then finally the death of war and ignorance

and that Infernal library of excuses for I, me, my while you still lie in the gutter and starve and die

We will build a world untainted by selfish bastards where we'll be free range humans at last

and do whatever we fucking like all day and lay great brilliant eggs of knowledge and wisdom

and live under two suns at The expense of no one

finally out under the above for love for love

That is the night Isle and we set off and not a week's while

for our species. Try a one last. Pardon

We are going alone together

back to the garden

Ah Said me, sounds swell and what about those of us in the nursery do we get to come as well.

that's complicated. He said

we approached at last over a new isle of yet another style

My companion said to me why it seems you and I are at the end of our journey

the Isle of the eights For almost the century that has been the land upon where I lay my hat

Over we passed I peeked in through the glass of the windows all wide and saw books stacked as towers and folk reading inside

What do they do? I said they and you

Said he I told you of the soon trip to our new home

and though we have solved much of the perils of travels in Space

there is but one more problem we faced on

our journey We want to take with us every film and thesis every book and treatise the mulch of every culture

But not even the moon would have enough room to store those works physically

and digitally If we were to store it That way

cosmic rays would see wipe it right out in but a few hundred days mid-flight

and so we found a method Yes a fur

Human brains

each seven and eight like me commits to their memory some chosen book or speech to preserve until we reach the new house

We learn to remember to not forget I said and which work lives in your head

said he prose and poetry Eighteenth to 23rd century

for like you I once had a grandfather who showed me the world in a manner I could understand

Back when the old world was still new and so was I I'd sit on his knee and he'd reached me long into the evening

of fiction and farce or whatever I asked and for all those stories absurd they gave me a passion for the percussion of words and

That's how I knew what it was. I'd remember

I said and your grandfather now is he Yet still alive?

but our basket sat down then at last we'd arrived.

we Disembarked single file on another new Beach on another new Isle

nay. I said wait, I remember this land aye, he said it's the same from the one we began

and then standing not feet from our great steed balloon was a woman there Staring at the dead fractured moon

the woman called out why what a fair moon this evening aged So it's the exudes a vital glow

she turned on me said though true the same cannot be said for you

Well, no I said since I am not aged so

my companion bowed his head said nothing Oh ye

she said what the centuries have done to your memory.

I replied you must be mistaken I am from the nursery

said she there is nursing there certainly, but for those so aged they cannot nurse themselves

I am the matron of the nursing dome and I am here to take you home

by choice Will you come back with me or need I summon armed security

now Look I said I am 20 or 21 rather and I have come to find my grandfather

So why she said yet? You walk hunched and move slow such would we expect of one born a millennium ago?

What said I and raised a hand to my eyes and found the skin was cracked and cold or one might venture old

She said how to put it Well, oh, yes Your generation is the reason the fall fell

all greed and in need of speed and more patting yourselves on the back for progress

Meanwhile, leaving every garden unweeded and all who fell behind unfed then dead

You have been honorably discharged of being dishonorably in charge

and while we aren't as cruel as to have you all put down We sure Shant opt for having you around

and so you are most welcome to the ocean floor where you shan't ruin the world Yet more.

Yeh beneath the sea there are jigsaw puzzles and rocking chairs that wait again for thee next time

We'll be sure to lock the doors. I am taking you back to the seabed once more

to the matron My companion said why I'm sorry. I took him on a tour of the land I only hoped he'd remember or at least understand

but before you bring him home might for five minutes you leave us alone

Rose a skeptical eyebrow on her skeptical face though. She nodded and plodded off some while away

Oh gods, I cried and closed my eyes to my companion I said this is the dementia you mentioned.

Yes he said I thought maybe with an hour or two it would come back to you and you'd return to the nursing dome on your

Own it's time for you to go home if there's anything I can do for you

Yes You can said I let me lie here for the rest of my days

above the water in some semblance of a dignified way

I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. He said I wish you luck in all hence.

I said don't apologize There's no taken offense

Why in a day or two I suppose I'll remember neither the beach nor you

Thank you for my big day out.

We hugged them in the awkward male fashion two loose grips and a little back tapping

He turned about bound inland bound starwort.

No great elation. No great despair I simply gulped the salt sea air

and wondered then if I would ever breathe it again

My companion paused and turned about let out they gave me an early warning

the nursing dome I mean when you made your great escape

Gave me time to reach the beach and wait in hope you'd rise alive from the waters

And so you did and so I found you

Early warning why I said What're you to me or I to thee

he said my grandfather was never the sort to go quietly Once caught

said I that may be and yet your grandfather is not me

said he

but you are

Have you been so by time defiled? You don't recall your own grandchild?

It was I who sent a letter hoping for the better you'd recall who I was

and though you remembered me fine You mixed me up in time. I did not want to leave you down here without one last try Oh, goodbye

I didn't know for my sake you'd stage a fucking Prison Break. I only meant to say goodbye

Well I said then hello

Oh God I remember

between the fields and owls and Shrike long hours teaching you how to ride a bike.

Yes He said yes said me

I remember year upon my knee and from the elm tree sat ten starlings deep and I'd read to you till you fell asleep

Yeah, he said

and the alphabet and cigarettes and Ethernet and tape cassettes

it was the old world and I think of it every day and I think of you on the sea bed every day

and because Ruin the world or not You are my grandfather and I am your blood

and while you may not remember those Kindnesses you did me when I was little I do and I will remember for both of us

And if one day I have children, I will tell them of you

So they even when I am gone your kindnesses will thread on down the hooks of your descendants

And then your kindnesses will never die

And when both of us are gone when we're only stories it will still live on

until there and all the time and space snuff To dust and dust enough. There'll be two facts lying leftover in dead eternity

that You are my grandfather and I loved you

and I cannot spend another week worrying that alone and decrepit beneath the sea sits you while I won't soft as Xanadu

even if I make it to the edge of space over the threshold We'll still be there your old sad face

I said yet all the while you are still bound for the ninth Isle and I for jigsaws and sliding doors

I just hope you recall me in good stead

he replied then you may wish of me the same tomorrow for I am staying right beside your empty head

and I Protested but you set off for the Stars in not a week You said

Rockets be damned said my grandson one day they'll build another. It's what humans do

but grandfathers are a one-time Construction and these may be my last days with you.

Let's run back to the old world. Let's find the tree ten starlings deep and I'll read you till you fall asleep

and if little pieces of yesterday come back to you Whenever

then tell me and we'll remember them together

and back down the beach back to the balloon We're off on the wind then and under the moon

at lasts borne back ceaselessly into the past

And from our basket Sebastian yelled with all his might.

Hey matron go fuck yourself big kiss. Good night

The new world pulled away behind and on some perfect fever dreams frontier the old world drew near

something Waited and though dead for sure it waited to receive us once More

and my grandson began to shout the poems would known from the tomes we'd owned and the lines came back easily even to me

We remembered we remembered together.

Let us go then you and I he yelled when the evening is spread out against the sky I replied

like a patient etherized upon a table Let us go through certain half-deserted streets the muttering retreats

of restless nights and one night cheap hotels and Sawdust restaurants with oysters

about about in reel and route the deaf fires Danced at night the water like a witch's oils burned green and blue and white

and summoned dreams Assured world the spirit that plagued us so nine fathom deep here followed us from the land of mist and snow

In Xanadu did Kubla Khan a stately pleasure-dome decree where alph the sacred River ran through caverns measureless to man down to a sunless sea

So twice five miles of fertile ground with walls and towers were girth round and there were Gardens bright with sinuous rills Where blossomed many an incense bearing trees and he were forest


Title: How to Be Correct About Everything All the Time - YouTube - English.txt
One day Mr. Sun and Mr. Wind were having an argument about who was stronger,

when they spotted a man walking along the road.

They challenged one another to see who could get the man to remove his coat.

Well, it was Mr. Wind's turn first, and Mr. Wind said:

"Right, lads, let's fucking rush him!"

and began to blow and blow.

But despite all of this the man only buttoned his coat tighter,

and Mr. Wind blew some more until he was exhausted.

But now it was Mr. Sun's turn.

Unlike Mr. Wind, Mr. Sun was very modest and restrained, and said:

"Right, you dopey c*nt,"

and began to shine and shine, all the while quietly whispering:

"Take off your fucking coat, you stupid cu**."

And the day got warmer and warmer, and sure enough, the man took off his coat,

proving once and for all that it's always nicer just to be nice.

Well, Mr. Sun was rather pleased with himself, as you can imagine.

"Oi! You see that, you fucking wind cu**?"

And the day continued to warm up, and the man took off his t-shirt, because it was hot.

And next he took off his trousers, revealing a number of politically reprehensible tattoos,

and Mr. Wind said:

"Look what you've done, you stupid sun cu**. Look what you've gone and fucking done!"

For a very long time, many of us believed that the Earth was at the center of the solar system, called "geocentrism",

and, to be fair, it does kind of look that way from the ground, if you don't know better.

But plenty of people in history pushed for a "sun at the center model" called "heliocentrism".

One proponent was a rather clever 16th century philosopher called Giordano Bruno.

He also believed that stars were distant suns with their own planets –

in the 1500s, remember.

A normal idea today, pretty whack-a-doodle back then.

*Heh* Anyway...

The Catholic Church of the day were big supporters of Bruno's heliocentric ideas,

and celebrated his genius by lighting a big lovely bonfire,

which they popped him on top of!

Centuries later in the early 1900s,

and scientist Alfred Wegener noticed that the continents fit together a bit like an awkward jigsaw puzzle,

particularly Eastern South America and Western Africa.

He came up with a theory of continental drift –

the idea that the continents started as one big megamass called Pangea and slowly drifted apart over millions of years.

"Hey, that's a great idea,"

no geologist of the day said, and continued to fling intellectual shit at him non-stop for the remainder of his life.

It would take about 70 years –

or one Bill Murray –

for folks to realize he was actually spot on.

Kind of difficult to apologize, though, what with him being dead and everything.

September 15, 1999, and the Mars Climate Orbiter is just about to enter Mars orbit.

It does – though with a little too much enthusiasm,

barbecuing itself.

The reason? Because the spacecraft was quite sensibly using metric measurements,

while the software back on earth was using imperial.

I can sympathize, somewhat –

having left England years ago, I'm still only able to conceive of the world in terms of stone, inches,

and repressed childhood sadness!

Anyhow...

That's all just the beginning, really,

because the history of human civilization is one long failure of critical thinking.

Like the time humans invited a big wooden horsie into Troy;

like the time humans killed Julius Caesar in an attempt to save the Roman Republic,

and killed the Roman Republic;

like the time humans prescribed cocaine to treat hay fever,

and meth as a diet pill,

and heroin as a cough syrup –

to children!

Like the time humans repeatedly kept insisting on invading Russia...

during the winter.

It's far too cold. Wear a fucking...

It's far too cold. Wear a fucking... hat...

Or some nice booties...

OR MAYBE SOME FUCKING GLOVES!

We are not a species built for critical thinking.

Just to illustrate the scale of the problem:

Is this a duck...

*quack*

...or a bunny?

*chitter*

Or, which of the two orange circles is bigger –

the one on the left,

or the one on the right?

Neither: they're both the same size...

Likewise, which is rotating faster – the sphere, or the column in the center?

Neither – it's a still image, your brain is kindly animating it for you.

And, finally, if you run your eyes over each of these cat pictures,

is there one in particular that stands out?

The answer is this one, obviously,

because she's MY cat and she's FUCKING GORGEOUS!

And these are just silly optical illusions that trip us up.

How the hell are we supposed to see true reality when it comes to things that actually matter in our lives?

Well, for as long as we've been trying to grapple with ol' Johnny Reality,

there has been an enemy sabotaging us at every turn.

They live in our brain bits, and they are called "logical fallacies".

The correlation fallacy, for example.

We live in a world now swamped in data and numbery-wumbers,

and it makes it very tempting to look for correlations.

One that took a shamefully long time to admit was the now obvious link between death sticks and lung cancer.

Then again, careful there, chuckles,

there's also a highly compelling correlation between the number of people who drowned by falling into swimming pools from 1999 onwards

and the number of films around that time Nicholas Cage appeared in.

Correlation does not necessarily imply causation.

Begging the question.

This is the Ouroboros of bullshit logic.

Someone declares: "I own your house now."

You respond: "Why?"

They respond: "Because I have your keys."

"Why do you have my keys?"

"I already told you, jerko – because I own your house."

You will see this all the time in public debates,

very weak tea indeed.

The slippery slope.

Perhaps you suggest to someone that it might be time for them to give up snorting detergent.

A slippery slope response would be: "Well, what do I give up next?

Shoes, then water, then breathing!?

IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT!?"

No, this is clearly not what you meant.

It is possible to make a change to the status quo without the complete collapse of physical reality.

The false dichotomy.

This is the dick move of presenting an A-B choice that isn't actually A or B.

These include things like,

"Well, either we save the rainforests, or we save the whales. You decide!"

What? Why? Can't we just do both?

Or, one that really gets my goat:

"If science can't prove everything immediately about how the world works,

then it must all be magic."

...Wat? Why can't there just be an honest gap between science and truth called

"We don't know yet, but we'll get there one day"

NOFKYOlogy, motherlovers! ;)

And that's not even the half of it!

Our brains are riddled with these bastards, ready to trip us up at any moment:

the argument from tradition,

the argument from false authority,

the argument from "because I read half a fucking Wikipedia article" –

we are constantly falling prey to silly patterns of thought,

and the only safeguard against them is eternal vigilance.

And possibly drugs! :)

All that being said, one point that rarely gets brought up in critical thinking

is that there is something more satisfying than winning arguments,

and that's not getting into arguments.

As a kid and a teen, I was quite obsessed with psychic phenomena, like telekinesis and telepathy.

But the more I looked into it, the more it all just seemed like anecdotal evidence,

and so far, no psychic feats confirmed under fair experimental conditions.

All the same, I finally lost my faith one day while watching UK daytime TV,

and one of those psychics was on, claiming to talk to dead people's relatives.

I'm sure you know the drill:

"Hey, anyone in the audience know a dead person whose name begins with E?"

*Chirping crickets*

"...or J?.."

*Chirping crickets*

"...or any letter in the English alphabet?"

"Ooo, I do!"

" And they're telling me they knew you somehow..."

"Oh God, yeah, it was my grandfather!"

"And they're telling me they were your grandfather."

"Wow, that's incredible, how did you do that?"

"And I'm sensing they died from something that made them dead."

"Oh my god, he's a wizard!"

Why do these ghosts always have really specific messages,

but simultaneously can only remember the first letter of their own fucking names?

Anyway, it suddenly hit me:

"Hmm, either this guy is actually talking to the dead, which will completely revolutionize modern science,

or this motherfucker is taking advantage of fragile people who are grieving for their loved ones,

and he's doing it for monetary gain."

Which is a very special flavour of evil, I hope you will agree.

It destroyed my faith in psychics and gave me, shall we say,

an overly passionate dislike of people making big metaphysical claims they couldn't back up.

And every time I came across people at parties or over dinner who hinted at even the most gentle metaphysical sentiments –

"Ah, everything happens for a reason," or whatever –

I became, there is no other way to put it, an obnoxious dick,

because I associated all of them with this one guy I'd seen on TV.

I was... insufferable.

Years later, however, I was eating dinner with some friends and a friend of a friend had joined.

The new guy noticed I wasn't eating meat and asked,

and I said, "Ah, I'm not really into it," and attempted to leave the thing there.

But he followed it with: "Well, if you care about animals so much,

why are you still eating dairy products? That's cheese on your plate, isn't it?"

"Uh-huh," I said. "Anyway..."

"Well", he continued for some time,

"I mean, you're not really making a difference. You're probably just trying to demonstrate how morally superior you think you are to everyone else."

"Yes, that's a fair point," I said.

...In the universe where I'm a Buddhist monk.

In this universe, I said:

"Uuuuhhh, go fuck yourself! And who the fuck are you anyway?"

And, of course, an argument began, ruining dinner completely.

Months later, though, somehow, we calmed down and discussed the incident, him and I.

And he was decent enough to explain that he had a roommate

who constantly yelled at him for enjoying steak, or bangers and mash, or whatever,

and he had automatically put me into that very same camp.

Much like I had believed anyone who wasn't a hardcore scientific materialist like me

must be a con artist.

And that was kind of humbling, because I was no more going to yell at him for enjoying a bratwurst

than those poor people I'd been mean to over dinner were gonna con me out of money

to talk to my dead childhood hamster.

And it seems suddenly that arguments about ideas usually rely on two fundamental constants:

1) Everyone thinks they're being reasonable, however insane their position is,

and 2) No one's going to change their mind by getting called a dick.

Looking back on that unpleasant dinner, I should have just calmed down and said:

"You seem a bit irritated, mate. What's up?"

And we probably could have sorted things there and then.

But my pride was hurt, and that was all I could think about.

Some days, you're the pigeon,

some days, you're the statue,

and almost all of us are ignorant about almost everything.

The world is too big not to be.

But, miraculously, finding the mental strength to say

"Alright mate, you seem a bit annoyed. Let's talk about it,"

is always going to get a better result than "go fuck yourself".

It relies on constantly remembering that the primary characteristic of a silly person

is that they think they're clever, and usually enjoy insisting that they're correct about everything,

Which makes admitting to ignorance a rather rare and endearing virtue.

In other words, what would Socrates do?

That's a very different mantra, by the way, to

to "what would Diogenes do?" because the answer to that one would be

"piss on people you disagree with and take a shit in the theater."

Incidentally, just a small personal request to the New Theater Royal in Portsmouth:

please give my season ticket back –

I promise I won't do it again.

Despite our species being the smartest smartypantsers on the planet,

human children are some of the most helpless infants in the entire animal kingdom.

Baby giraffes can stand up just hours after their birth,

but it takes our infants years before they can be left unsupervised.

That means we have to take care of them for a long time,

out of nothing but kindness.

That's me, by the way, back when I couldn't stand up and lived on a liquid diet –

so, no much has changed, really...

Cheers!

I often marvel at the fact my mom and dad spent all that time raising me, and protecting me, and teaching me.

They did it because they are kind.

It is a debt I can never repay, and they wouldn't expect me to, either.

That kindness is what kept me alive, and some variation of it was what kept all of us alive in those early years.

Do you know – a lower jaw bone was found in Dmanisi, Georgia, some time back now?

It belonged to a member of the homo erectus family, our now extinct human cousins.

He was a male of about 40 years old, who lived probably 2 million years ago.

The jaw is missing all its teeth except for one.

And we know he lived a long time like that,

which means someone was helping him to eat.

Two million years ago, someone was feeding him.

Someone cared about him, maybe someone loved him –

back in deep time, even before our species began,

a person or a group was practicing compassion.

Someone was being kind for the sake of being kind.

I think about that two million year old jawbone a lot these days.

I like to imagine a little pack of our evolutionary cousins huddled around a fire, knowing little, understanding even less,

before recourse to reason, or law, or history,

before currency and standing armies,

before socks,

and probably with no concept that one day, two million years in the future,

their cousins – us – would build this incredible global project of civilization,

and if there was some way we could have shown our cousins and ancestors just how far humans would one day come,

everything would seem alien to them –

except, perhaps, for compassion.

Because though they lived in perpetual ignorance,

though they were incorrect about almost everything all the time,

from that jawbone in Georgia,

from other ancient skeletons telling almost exactly the same story,

we know that they had kindness.

And it is the same kindness that today raises our kids and takes care of our elderly.

It's the same kindness that provides disaster relief or medical aid,

the same kindness that sustains friendships and writes love letters.

Do you ever get that weird "wow" moment sometimes, when you realize that the future isn't just this abstract sci-fi place – with hovercars or whatever –

it's ACTUALLY coming? Like, one day, it will ACTUALLY be the 22nd and 23rd centuries,

and they'll be just as pedestrian and real as the 21st century is to us?

And then, do you ever get that second "wow" moment when you realize that making it to those centuries isn't actually guaranteed,

that we could drop the ball at any moment,

and you think: "My god, is ANYONE making sure we're gonna be okay?

Is ANYONE actually steering the ship?"

'cause those sure are some big waves over there,

and we've never been this far out to sea before,

and maybe if we squint really hard, we can just about make out the promise of land centuries ahead.

But between the future and us are ten thousand furious storms –

of warfare, and infighting, and God knows we're in a crisis right this minute.

But our ancestors have been here before,

living forever on the knife-edge of ignorance and death,

at the constant mercy of systems inside and outside themselves

that they did not understand, just like us today.

And if there was one thing alongside intelligence and technology and wisdom,

if there was one thing that sustained them,

if there was ONE THING that got them through –

their bones are indisputable:

it was compassion.

It was kindness.

Doubtless, we will screw up in the future

with one million times the efficiency that we screwed up in the past.

We cannot, and will never be correct, about everything all the time.

Ignorance is in our bones.

But kindness is in our DNA.

And if anyone says otherwise...

Just tell them to fuck off.

With love, obviously...

With love.

Oh hi! Thanks for sitting through that.

Two things: firstly, I hope you enjoyed the opening animation,

because it was made by my best mate in the whole world – Mr. Jimmy Cakeshoes.

He's just starting out on here, and has a channel with a brilliant parody of Star Wars Episode 3,

which I laughed my ass off to, and I'm quite sure you will as well.

There is a link below if you'd like to go and check it out, or say hi, or wish him dead, etc.

It is an honor to have you working by my side, my man, and I'm just incredibly proud of you.

Second thing: I made a video a while ago called "thoughts about writing",

where I was trying to get down everything I wish I'd known about writing when I started writing,

but it was too bollocksy and abstract and it didn't work.

So what I have done is make some mini podcast episodes, if you like –

all about what to do If you're a creative type and you're having creative problems,

and also how to even get started with writing, or whatever else you want to do artwise.

We will cover everything – from finding inspiration to getting the sads, to creative burnout, to avoiding dark web narcotics.

The first few episodes are up on a separate channel,

there's a link below, and I will be uploading some more in the coming weeks – that's the plan, anyway.

I really hope you like them, I really hope they help with your creative endeavors;

big love, hope you're keeping safe, hope you're well.

New book coming soon, promise.

Dislike, unsubscribe, I detest you, goodbye... <3


Title: There&#39;s No Such Thing As Orange - YouTube - English.txt
what a miracle life is how lucky we are

to exist on this planet if even for a

short time

and i'll tell you what makes me feel

better about wasting that time and

probably dying alone

regularly consuming gigantic quantities

of

chocolate yes delicious eh but how does

chocolate end up in your terribly clever

brain as the taste of chocolate

well your tongue and your schnoz of

course your tongue is covered in several

thousand taste buds made up of about 50

gustatory receptor cells each

it's fairly accepted there are five

building blocks of taste sweet

sour salty bitter and umami umami

is basically the taste of savory stuff

green tea and shiitake mushrooms are

good examples if you're curious

that thing about different tongue

sections tasting different flavors isn't

true by the way but

heiho now for taste you'll need your

nose too your nose is full of cells

called olfactory sensory neurons quite

high up

different smells play these cells like

molecular keys on a piano

anyway the information about the taste

and smell of the chocolate from your

excellent beak and mouth waggler get

transmitted electrically to your brain

specifically the gustatory and olfactory

cortex and that's a great olfactory

cortex you have there by the way

and that information ends up somehow

turning into the perception of the taste

of chocolate

easy right okay but you don't see

chemical information about chocolate

scrolling across your eyes like the

terminator

you experience it as a sensation and

that is the rub

because we don't know yet how mata how

chemistry how sugar

and cocoa end up going from electrical

signals in your brain to the taste of

chocolate

the experience of chocolate in your mind

this is called the hard problem of

consciousness

and if you don't mind i would like to

convince you today that it is the

greatest mystery

in history the sensations of experience

are called

qualia qualia are the feels of something

how an experience tastes or looks or

sounds

take a sunset if you will in reality all

we're really seeing is wavelengths of

the electromagnetic spectrum

in this case around 600 nanometers if

we're being fancy schmancy

but your eyes turn those wavelengths

into information and your brain turns

that information

into yellow and orange into experience

and the colors themselves as you see

them are the qualia

the orangeness of orange it's the same

with the hotness of heat

the sweetness of chocolate the nausea of

a tummy ache the elements of

experience imagine you were talking to

someone who can't see color

how would you describe the color orange

to them now you might say

it's like red but with more yellow in it

but that's not gonna work silly

they don't know what the experiences of

red and yellow are

have you ever chomped on some asparagus

then gone to pee a little while later

and almost passed out from the

disgusting smell

if you haven't that's because you don't

have the gene or genes to detect

asparagus metabolites

and you are one lucky papa because the

smell is

vile as far as we know only about half

the world population

are lucky enough to have the genetics to

detect it the funny thing is

if you don't have the genetics you'll

never know what it's like

you could train as a scientist and

specialize in the asparagus piss effect

and become the world's leading authority

on it bit weird

but you do you you could know everything

academically there was to know about the

asparagus piss effect

everything accepts the disgusting smell

itself everything except the qualia

and the qualia are everything if you've

never seen a certain color if you've

never tasted a particular flavor

hell if you've never been in love you

can read 10 000 eloquent descriptions of

whatever but that will never be the

qualia

description and experience live in two

separate universes

in reality of course there is no such

thing as asparagus piss or the color

orange or the sound of a kettle boiling

or the coldness of snow

and if somehow we could experience

objective reality directly

whatever that  means all you

would find in the real world outside of

our heads

is chemical compounds and wavelengths of

em radiation

and vibrations in the air and relatively

less energetic atoms

there is no orange it is just one of the

many millions of veils our brains drape

over reality to understand reality

and if the brain is an electrochemical

computer if it's just

meat how does it turn electricity into

experience

into the sweetness of chocolate into the

orange of a sunset

or from asparagus into the fine bouquet

of satan's taint

the hard problem of consciousness how

does the brain create

qualia now there are the so-called easy

problems of consciousness

stuff like how is it that you that is

your brain can shift your focus of

attention between stuff

or how do you categorize information

these are a bit like the problem of how

we'll get humans to mars or something

they're tricky problems but they're

technically feasible with enough cocaine

coffee

scientists will probably crack them one

day the reason why the hard problem of

consciousness is often considered the

big boy of questions

the hard problem is because as it stands

today we don't even have the beginning

of the beginning of a sensible answer to

it

how does this turn this into this how

does electricity get transformed into

colors and sounds and experience

and as much as us clever 21st century

carbon units know about the furniture of

reality

about the curvature of space-time and

the unpalatable presentation of a

baboon's arse

nothing yet in our now vast libraries of

the qualities of the natural world

have much to say about how meat makes a

mind

despite the fact that we're made up of

elements you'll find everywhere else in

the universe

hydrogen carbon nitrogen oxygen

accounting for 99 of our bodies

something about the way those elements

are put together turns into something

that knows it's made of matter in the

first place

and has experiences we're made of

universe but we actually know we're

universe

we are food that can enjoy food and yet

the hard problem

remains now what we're getting very good

at doing recently

is finding correlations between what

your brain and body is doing

physical you and what your mind is doing

at the same time

the wibbly consciousness  we know

that the hormone cortisol correlates

very closely with anxiety

we know that an altered gamma brainwave

pattern correlates very closely with

epilepsy and several mood disorders

or vice versa we know if you're enjoying

downton abbey erotic fan fiction

you'll probably be using your cerebrum

for processing the text and so on

we have a huge map of what brain area

and biological process

correlates with which mental state but

that doesn't tell us what the mechanisms

of qualia and consciousness are yet

any more than if you asked how voting

works in the uk and someone just showed

you a picture of number 10 downing

street

that's where that's not how incidentally

that little feline outside is called

larry

he is the current chief mouser to the

cabinet office that's not me being

quirky

it's true and he's a very good boy

alright the brain is a huge

unbelievably complicated network of

inputs and outputs

it can do graphics and audio and

parallel processing and storage

the thing is clearly a computer of sorts

but computation

can't be the end of the story because

computers are great at manipulating

information like us

but as far as we know computers don't

experience information like

us something is in this gap turning meat

into experiences

if indeed we are just meat there are a

million theories as to what that process

is of course

maybe consciousness is a fundamental

property of matter distributed across

the entire universe and brains focus it

somehow

maybe it's just what happens when you

integrate enough information in the

right way

or maybe it's a fancy illusion and what

it feels like to be you

is just the side quest your brain is

playing after it's already decided what

it's going to do anyway

but one thing is for sure every proposal

we have so far for qualia generation and

consciousness

requires the kind of explosive leap one

only experiences the morning after

eating california reaper peppers

elaborate as they are every explanation

so far is a physical description of

matter but what we want to know is how

mata becomes experience

we must propel ourselves off the toilet

of the brain mind correlation

towards the imodium of a final theory of

consciousness

we must collapse the duality of the

subjective and objective worlds

once and for all and talking of which

gosh

humans love dualities don't we good

versus evil wads of paper versus le

washi bumble

mind versus body

the mind body problem is about as angry

as you can make a philosopher

how can we explain what it's like to be

a mind if minds are made out of

universally dead

stuff so in a condescending pattern head

fashion the battle boils down to

materialism

versus non-materialism firstly the

argument from materialism then

materialism is basically the idea that

everything in the universe from galaxies

to the weather

to little hourly wows spring from

physics from mata

from quantum fields not wibbly extra

physical stuff

the heart is a machine there's no

wizards in your spleen as weird as it

may be

why can't consciousness be a biological

process like digestion or cell division

humans have a bit of a tendency for

claiming stuff we don't understand

is supernatural well it turns out the

sun isn't pulled up by a chariot

germ theory was a lot more of a powerful

explanation for disease than getting

cursed

yes consciousness is super weird it's

unlike any other phenomenon we've

discovered so far and we are in quite

the pickle trying to explain it

but we've been in pickles before the

origin of species the formation of

galaxies

the answer is almost impossible to

imagine until someone explains it

scientifically

and then it's so obvious we can't

believe we didn't get it earlier

give science and philosophy some time

with consciousness we've done it before

we'll  do it again then there is

the non-materialist response to that and

it sometimes goes

a little like this yes

science has been super powerful in

explaining the world around us

but hang on there dick pump everything

explained so far has been dead stuff

you can explain stars mechanistically

because they are mechanistic how

using our current picture of matter are

you going to jump from interactions and

physical qualities

to matter that knows its matter that

feels like a mind that has experiences

this isn't a gap because we don't have a

materialist theory yet it's a gap

because materialism can't account for it

even if you had a perfect map of

correlations between what the brain is

doing and how the person with the brain

feels

even if you had a special recipe that

goes take some neural oscillations

add in x amount of integrated

information sprinkle in some quantum

coherency

do a  backflip and then brains

will be conscious

isn't that still just a description

rather than an explanation again

anyway that's a pretty  caricature

of the materialist versus

non-materialist debate as it stands

today

if i've mischaracterized your position

please accept this vintage depiction of

a pomeranian

i hope we can still be friends and on

top of that you might reasonably wonder

why anyone should even give a  about

the hard problem of consciousness

or how consciousness arises anyway we

are conscious we can see sunsets

shut up but to that i would reply no

you yes we might be far off cracking

this thing

but if we crack it if we finally set up

a sturdy bridge between descriptions of

physical states and mental states

if we have a working theory of the

relationship between the brain and the

conscious mind

it won't just herald in a shower of

nobel prizes it will mean we can start

addressing

actual endgame meaning of life questions

we will have codified answers to the

existential quandaries dating back to

the ancients

like do we actually have free will and

is consciousness baked into matter or is

it an emergent phenomenon

and how do mothers turn food into

thinking conscious people in their

tummies

and could we one day make other stuff

conscious like machines or new

artificially organized states of matter

and how did evolution create conscious

animals anyway was it advantageous

somehow

and okay why was it how is it better

than just evolving biological robots

and for that matter how conscious are

our animal mates and just what

is a thought how are we thinking or

feeling for that matter how the hell are

we collecting

binding and experiencing sensory

information from the dead mathematical

world beyond

our minds and translating that into

chocolate and rakia and cold and rough

and misery and curiosity and

indifference and satisfaction and

ambivalence and

being just the feeling of being a being

what is qualia how is experience even

possible

why the  is orange

i'm going out for the day and don't

smoke all my weed again

there's a weird feeling you get

sometimes if you're into all this

consciousness stuff

because you can get knee deep in the

isms and the mud slinging and

philosophers bullshitting each other

and you suddenly step back and think oh

my god this isn't some highfaluting

academic problem the mystery is in me

the mystery is me right now at the

center of our heads is the point of

contention of millennia of debate

conscious experience it is the greatest

mystery

and if the greatest mystery of all time

was hiding anywhere else but inside our

own heads

we'd never stop  talking about it

but because it's so close

because it's us it barely gets mentioned

outside of academia

every sense coming in every color every

sound every taste

the mystery is yelling at us the whole

time how is experience possible

how am i possible what is inside me

doing all of this

and maybe the same goes for mammals for

marine life

god knows who else a bunch of non-human

animals

seem to have internal lives of some kind

don't doggos go mental when we come home

because they're actually feeling happy

to see us

didn't the killer whale j35 carry her

dead daughter's body

for a thousand miles refusing to let her

fall to the ocean floor

not out of some robotic inbuilt reflex

but because

she was sad because she was grieving

beyond narrative

beyond nations beyond history possibly

even beyond species in some cases

there is a common insane experience

being a living thing

in a cosmos of apparently dead things

being a thing that doesn't just process

information but feels and hopes and

regrets and hate and longs and dreads

the never-ending chatter of ourselves

talking to ourselves

who am i i wonder how mum's doing i'm

hungry i'm thirsty

should i be married by now i think the

milk is off do you still love me

i still love you how will i die when

will i be happy i should phone the post

office i should buy more toilet roll i

should worry less i should worry more

will anything ever make sense we don't

know how the consciousness trick is done

yet

and to be honest maybe we never will but

even then

even if we never do the mystery is here

and it's gorgeous

and it's everywhere as gk chesterton put

it

but now a great thing in the street

seems any human nod

where shift in strange democracy the

million masks of

god it is not a pleasant condition to

endure living in an age when we know

more about the heavens than we do the

mechanisms of our own heads

personally some days i find it

horrifying but things

are changing inside the sciences today

it's finally becoming fashionable to

study consciousness

the science of how we experience is just

getting going now

science is coming home from its mad

flight in the stars

back down the telescope to ask about the

mind looking up the telescope

we're living at the birth of a theory of

us and i will bet you my cash

on this in the miraculous event we

actually get through this teenage phase

in our development

we might stand the chance of maturing

into an adult species

we might live one day in a time of

perfect explanations and finished

science

when most things have been measured and

explained when the mechanisms of

consciousness and experience are as well

understood as the dynamics of flight are

today

but i will also bet you my cat that

there are eyes in that enlightened time

looking back longingly wishing they

could know what it was like

for us today to have lived in the great

age of mysteries

to have looked around and seen question

marks everywhere and found the courage

in spite of the dreadful uncertainties

in spite of not knowing how our souls

work to still carry on and still

be at least half decent back when humans

were clueless about their own mental

mechanisms

back in the quiet ignorance of the 21st

century in the days of wild unknowing

when all you needed to do to remind

yourself of how gorgeously weird the

world is

was to remember that for all we could

explain sound

we had no idea how it became music in

our minds

and to remember that for all we could

explain light we had no idea how it

became color

when all that was required to remember

just how close the unknown is to us

was to look up to the horizon around

evening and to know

that for all the mysteries of the sky

and beyond the sky

for all the mysteries of our sun and the

dust she came from

on any given evening below any given

sunset

as the heavens look down on us clearly

the real mystery all along

was looking back up at the heavens

out that ending is too

pretentious even for me bogeys

willies etc don't forget to brush your

teeth being alive is weird

until next time then


Title: Dear Nia - YouTube - English.txt
dear nia you died

seven months ago in the blaze of a drone

bomb when it fell

unceremoniously into our living room

where you sat working

there was a funeral it was fancy the

great death of a great scientist

and then they gave me the urn and i

didn't know what to do

just left it on top of the bookshelf and

whisked your ashes good morning and

wished your ashes goodnight

kidding myself that if i didn't scatter

them then none of this

would have happened i threw out some of

your clothes and

slept next to the rest your smell is

fading from them already

and i think soon enough i won't remember

what you smelled like at all

i perform the standard rituals i feed

the cats i drink

liberally i watch the higgs fall out on

the horizon at night

the war goes on i've surrendered already

sauron dear sauron

it was strange and good and strange

to get your message though on this side

it was you

who died seven months ago in the fire of

that drone bomb

as it came streaking into not the living

room but the kitchen

at my request you weren't cremated but

buried

you can imagine what a thing it was

today to visit your grave

then come home to find your message

waiting for me but i'm glad you wrote

we are living in those strange first

years of a new technology

when language can't capture what it is

yet i told a friend

about your message she called it a

seance but

a seance is for the dead and you're not

dead

and you are dead and you're not dead

it's

horrible to think all it took that bomb

to wander into the kitchen rather than

the living room

with some tiny perturbation in the air

above our house

the war is distant on this side i

haven't seen the higgs clouds in weeks

and i am not in an urn thank you for

your message

dear nia i am trying not to cry at my

keyboard

i wasn't even sure you'd reply your lab

friends have told me that the bridge

between us should stay open for a few

weeks

but they can't guarantee anything when i

got permission to use the equipment they

warned me not to get my hopes up

that even if i found you you probably

wouldn't be from a world line

i recognized you wouldn't be ania i

recognized

but i do recognize you your words sound

like mineir

i hope that's who you are whatever this

strange magic you've invented is it's

your legacy now

on this side they talk about you like

you're some great martyr of science

but now i know you're the best kind of

martyr a living one

you are missed the dog doesn't sleep on

our bed anymore but waits for you

at the door you still get posts

sometimes too i'll

scan and attach it with this message

it's just very

very good to hear from you soren dear

soren

i think maybe you're not clear how this

works you told me the war is still going

strong

on your side it's almost over for us i

don't want to make you sad but that

means

our world lines are getting distant

already i know you could never stand

jargon but

look the equipment uses a single

particle suspended

in superposition just at the moment of

wave function collapse

it lives half in your world line half in

mind it is

a fragile bridge between two splitting

universes

that's how we're talking every time a

particle's wave function collapses

it births new world lines new universes

splitting off like coral and then more

particles deviate inside those world

lines

more coral branching out every

measurement of the world fracturing the

world again

and again new universes born over and

over side by side

this isn't just about your world line

and mine there are

quadrillions of them next door there is

a world line where

yes i stayed for a few more hours at

work that night and the bomb never fell

on me and we're both still alive

there's a world line where the bomb got

both of us there's a world line where we

never met

but how much does your wildline and mind

differ

maybe you're near like scrambled eggs or

tolerate jazz or hated autumn or

whatever

we'll never know but we are not from the

same world

i don't mean to be cold but please

understand this gift

for what it is it's not the beginning of

a correspondence

it's a chance to say goodbye my husband

is in that graveyard

your wife is in that urn please don't

send me her post again

i am not your nier the army retook

hypatia today

the war's almost over for us thank you

for your message

nia dear nia well

in this world line you didn't like

scrambled eggs or jazz so how's that for

more evidence you are who i think you

are

yes things are a little different on

this side yes hypatia is gone for me

already it got higgs to dust a few weeks

ago but that's world history not

us i'm sitting in our garden writing

this our garden staring at

our roses and a world line away maybe

you're sitting here too

at this very moment right next to me

when you built this thing

this technique whatever the hell it is

what did you want to use it for

what could be a better application than

this a second chance

we're just a universe distant don't

throw this away

please it was until death do us part and

you are alive and i am alive and don't

throw this away

yours devotedly soarin

dear soren there aren't any roses in our

garden

not here you're still not getting it are

you even if the only difference between

your wildline and mine was a gust of

wind above our house seven months ago

that difference has changed everything

we have

many bridges to many other world lines

on this side

we've heard from some that never had the

war and many more that have been hixed

to oblivion with our village gone

with the cities gone i've spoken with

them with some of the survivors

i've offered my condolences and then

i've turned off the magnetic field

and let the wave function collapse so i

can never talk to them

again because i have nothing to say that

would help them because they are not

us i am not from that world line where

the sky is burst open with the higgs

fallout

i am not from the world line where you

lost me you asked why i built the

equipment

officially as a screw you to the

copenhagen theorists

unofficially because i knew there must

be at least one world line

where a single cell hadn't begun the

process of dividing madly out of control

inside mara's body and we'd never lost

her

to cancer i found one of those world

lines eventually

she is 11 now she has your stupid

sentimental streak

she has my pragmatism i spoke to her for

an evening

just like you and i are doing now i told

her i missed her

and what did she say she said okay

because what can she say in her world

line she still has parents

still has her life she said okay because

i am not

her mother i am not her mother in the

same way as i am not

your wife i let her go and you need to

let me go now

i believe one day when this technology

reaches fruition

that humans will develop a new sense an

evolutionary adaptation

for seeing ourselves as one among

billions of branching versions of our

possible selves for intuiting that we're

not individuals

but simultaneous travelers across the

atlas of if

you and i don't have that adaptation and

so we're still seeing the world lines

as periscopes into parallel worlds but

they're not

their mirrors cracked distorted

fairground mirrors

you are the 586th soren to contact me

and you are the 586th soren who i will

inform

first that i miss him and second

that i am severing the bridge now

because i am severing the bridge now

i can't stop you contacting the other

widowed niers

maybe there's a softer kind of me out

there who will keep this game up with

you who will send letters

to a ghost i wish you luck finding her i

wish you luck with the war

i wish you luck moving on take comfort

in knowing that beside our grey

half-lives a world line away who knows

what became of a single subatomic

deviation

great palaces in the sky continents

without starvation

or deprivation and somewhere across the

coral

you and i are still swimming together

yours

probabilistically near

dear near that's very poetic but i think

you're just hurting like i am

grieving is horrible i know it but

please don't do anything rash with the

connection

i'll be sitting by my inbox all day just

right back as soon as you dear nia

it's been a week of nothing from you now

i know you're upset i'm sure it must all

be strange but

things are getting horrible here and i

wish you'd write you were always

stubborn but i could always win you

around and i hope

it's one of those times dear near

they've started higgsing everything now

and i don't think it's long before the

radiation reaches us

please just tell me how you are please

tell me you're okay please tell me

something

for the sake of even an iota of decency

will you please just write back

hell you built all of this you can't

just take nia a month

a month of nothing you're right maybe

there are differences in the world lines

my nia was never this stubborn or myopic

would never have trodden heartlessly on

the hearts of those around her

are you going to leave me trapped here

trapped with this urn and the blue hell

dust on the horizon

and the bodies in the streets and the

noise and the hangover mornings

and the stumbling nights my god it meant

nothing did it not a damn thing not you

and i no civility not peace agreements

not civilization

all of it just some stupid veneer to

cover up how dumb we still all are

fine leave me here

dear madam it is with great pleasure

that we award you the title of

a doctor of philosophy specifically in

the field of the foundations

of quantum mechanics i would like to

personally apologize

for our delaying of awarding your

doctorate but as i'm sure you understand

your research was somewhat unorthodox

particularly the correspondences you

submitted

between your counterpart and the

counterpart of your husband

from the so-called parallel world lines

i have

since used your technique to speak to my

counterparts from several world lines

and can report the experience is a

strange one

though will no doubt become a common

practice for us all

soon enough i can also recommend several

therapists

i have subsequently required the

services of now that these

so-called world lines have been

confirmed i would also like to seek your

approval of my forwarding your thesis

to the ministry of defence in light of

the global conflict

our world line has apparently narrowly

avoided

in any case congratulations i look

forward to

receiving you and your fellow colleagues

at the doctoral awards ceremony at the

end

of this month i have taken the liberty

of reserving seats there

for your husband and daughter who given

their

in some sense featuring in your research

i confess an interest in meeting

in person your ceremonial gown and

bonnet can be rented

via companies i have provided the

details of below free parking for the

ceremony can be found in the designated

blue areas

if you have any special dietary

requirements regarding the celebratory

lunch

please

you


Title: Buddhism is Kinda Out There_ Man - YouTube - English.txt
morning comes and you wake your first

awareness is of boundless misery you

long for some kind of caffeinated

beverage so you can be miserable faster

you exit your place of dwelling and

enter the beverage establishment a few

streets down coffee please you say to

the barista milk or no milk they ask ah

milk please you say colombian or

brazilian beans colombian you say it

really doesn't matter northern or

southern colombia really i i don't mind

i don't mind good choice now beans that

grow at three thousand or four thousand

feet what difference does i don't care i

don't care well there are at least

fifteen thousand growers in that region

i really don't mind would you prefer

your grower likes or dislikes rappers

whose names begin with the prefix lil

what little pump for example

what i don't give a lil yachty

little uzi vert

little chair little table

little dachshund little harpsichord

little tokamak nuclear fusion reactor

well buddhists believe that is the human

condition

sort of a perpetual cycle of chasing

after contentment and ultimately

receiving only dissatisfaction this

dissatisfaction is called dukkha and

this game of rebirthing over and over

into dissatisfaction happens in samsara

which is where we live apparently and

the idea is we stay in samsara living

learning dying being reborn until we

hopefully attain enlightenment but

what's enlightenment how is wisdom

achieved what in the sweet bejesus is

going on with giraffes tongues no but

look at that

and that

and just

it's been a weird year well for all of

that we'll need to talk about the big

man himself

siddhartha gautama who you will surely

recognize from his stage name the buddha

we begin in nepal about two and a half

thousand years ago siddhartha gautama is

born into a cushy royal family and

trying to be nice siddhartha's dad

shields him from the nasty things in

life and keeps him in a massive palace

until at 29 years old on a red jaunt

outside the palace siddhartha notices

people who are like way sick and like

way old and like way dead and realizes

as my climber friends insist on

informing me the universe is a pretty

gnarly place bro so soon after he leaves

his kingdom and sets off in search of a

way to rid the world of suffering it's a

long story but finally siddhartha sits

under a tree determining that he will

not get up again until he has realized

the true nature of mind the demon mara

approaches him and tries to lure

siddhartha away from enlightenment with

distraction and lust but siddhartha is

like i'm busy cheers and indeed becomes

enlightened and attains nirvana nirvana

literally meaning to blow out to

extinguish we'll get to it in a bit but

it was then that siddhartha became the

buddha or literally the awakened one

because he was now free of the three

great poisons delusion greed and hate so

one would imagine he was as my climber

friends like to say pretty stoked bro

and on your marks get set buddhism a

world religion is born oh yeah the

slightly tubby smiling guy you might

have seen little statuettes of yeah

that's probably not the buddha but budai

a 10th century monk he's also thought by

some to be maitreya who's maitreya okay

this gets wiggly so buddhist philosophy

is kinda out there man and while

buddhists don't really have a creation

myth the universe wasn't spoken or

sneezed into being they do have some

fairly trippy ideas about time often in

buddhism and hinduism cosmic duration is

divided into eras called kalpas when

asked how long one type of kalpa was the

buddha allegedly said the length of time

it would take to reduce a mountain 16 by

16 by 60 miles to the size of a seed if

you rubbed it with a silk cloth once a

century so a while now in some

interpretations siddhartha gautama

wasn't the first buddha to turn up there

have apparently been a bunch before and

will apparently be a bunch after and the

next buddha to turn up in our current

era in our current calper ages from now

is supposed to be maitreya represented

here and possibly represented here also

by this gentleman and that's who the

little tubby man is so yeah

yeah yeah

after about 45 years of teaching the

buddha died in 483 bce we'll just jump

ahead a bit because i'm bored and two

millennia later and buddhism has

fractured into a bunch of different

schools one is tibetan buddhism and this

next cheerful gentleman is of course the

current dalai lama it's tempting to

think of the dalai lama as the pope of

buddhism and kinder but the real pope

isn't the head of christianity just the

catholic church and the dalai lama isn't

the head of buddhism he's the spiritual

leader of tibetan buddhism dalai lamas

aren't elected they're found when a

dalai lama dies the high lamas leave it

a while then go looking for the child

and the deceased dalai lama has

apparently reincarnated as then once

confirmed the child is taken off to

lhasa the capital of tibet to begin the

process of learning to become the dalai

lama again the first dalai lama was born

about 700 years ago and rose from a poor

child born in a cattle pen to become one

of the most respected teachers in

central asia and is rumored to have

attained buddhahood then did a spot of

the old dying then came dalai lama ii

electric buddhalu at the age of four a

child in the tsang region of tibet

declares mom dad i am in fact the dalai

lama and i'd like to see my monks again

and is confirmed as the first

reincarnation of the dalai lama he has a

good run and dies in meditation at the

age of 67. his reincarnation is found

just a few years later and so on and so

on up until the sixth dalai lama so this

is a weird one due to events to

finickity to go into the sixth

incarnation was recognized as the dalai

lama a bit late around the age of 15. a

few years later though when it got time

to take his full vows he refused and it

was not uncommon to see him staggering

drunk around larsa and visiting brothels

for some scripture and chill maybe he

also wrote some romantic and like kind

of sometimes kinky poetry if i could

meditate as deeply on the sacred texts

as i do on you i would clearly be

enlightened in this lifetime as in

school is cool but baby for you i got it

bad as we discussed tibetan buddhism is

just one branch of many but across all

the various schools of buddhism mahayana

theravada and so on there are some

pillars that are just universally agreed

upon to begin with there are the four

noble truths which are one existing is a

bit crap namely full of dukkha

dissatisfaction to be is to want to want

is to eventually be dissatisfied we

grasp the things monies funnies feline

tummies sometimes we get them then we

just keep grasping for more two the

cause of suffering is craving wanting is

the problem buddhist claim nothing not

mansions not games that aren't buggy on

release can ever be so satisfying they

kill desire desire is the problem

because it never ends three the end of

suffering comes with the end of desire

the end of grasping the end of craving

the way out of the forest of suffering

is not to pound down cheeseburgers and

goldly vodka until every desire is gone

but to extinguish the flame of desire

itself to quote a famous line let go or

be dragged and finally four everything

will apparently be alright if you follow

the eightfold path which is basically

crossfit for buddhists and if i can

think of any theologically appropriate

jokes maybe we'll get to it but time is

short and i'm an alcoholic not an

educator and while we're at it how about

we do the three marks of existence the

three constants of being alive the first

mark of existence is ducker

dissatisfaction but we've done this one

already and i hope you're listening

because there will be a test at the end

the second is anicha or anika basically

impermanence reality according to

buddhism is a transient ever-changing

thing oh you might reply such a

revelation much deep what next fire is

hot blob fish are gross well actually

blobfish aren't gross incidentally thank

you if you keep seeing this image around

that's a blobfish when it's pulled out

of the water normally blobfish prefer to

stay at between two thousand and four

thousand feet in the ocean where they

look like reasonable fish they look like

that because we yank them out of the

water and it's one thing that we have

the audacity to troll them out of the

ocean in the first place but it's quite

another to malign their appearance by

pretending that's what they actually

look like because they don't much like

if a huge hook came down and pulled one

of us into space and aliens just sat

around chuckling at our vacuum frozen

nitrogen swollen corpses going well

humans aren't very pretty after all

anyway chaps how about nanty mata

brewski stop it leave blobfish alone

excuse me reality to our buddhist

friends is a formless swirling dance of

his from the entropic decaying galaxies

to the tide eroded rocks of the beach

all is flux all is changed and you will

die but so will i so it's all right our

inability to accept a nietzsche to

accept that everything is impermanent is

apparently a large source of our dukkha

of our suffering and because we refuse

to accept change we cling to illusions

of permanence we cling to the stories we

tell ourselves about ourselves and to

the fleeting forms of the world and on

that note let me tell you what a

pleasure it is to live in one's third

decade of life when you can still enjoy

not just the persistent facial acne you

thought would go away over a decade ago

but at the very same time begin to

notice gray hairs popping up and say hi

while you stare at yourself helplessly

in the bathroom mirror feeling 19 again

and simultaneously 90 nine

the third mark of existence is called

anata and it's well you know months ago

i came down with the cheeky spot of the

old you-know-what virus i'm fine thanks

for not asking and trapped indoors for

weeks and almost terminally bored i

became quite massively addicted to a

game called town of salem which no one

is paying me to tell you about i just

kind of liked it so very briefly you're

assigned a random role at the beginning

of the game you might be a member of the

town as in the goodies or the baddies

the witch for example basically the card

game mafia anyway you don't have to play

long before you start noticing that

whenever you're assigned as a goodie you

sort of automatically hate the evil

players for being so deceptive and then

again when you're evil you can't stand

all those life-affirming do-gooder

morons and you start to have this

creeping suspicion that quite a lot of

what goes on in our gelatinous meat

computers is kind of context dependent

because just as in the game in life

we're assigned roles we have to play of

course student employee spouse scripted

pretentious know it all online etc and

like in the game sometimes it's hard to

tell where the roles stop and our

genuine personalities begin and the

buddhist answer to this is that it's not

just the world that's impermanent but

ourselves in it our outer identities are

shifting all the time of course and

that's just the external stuff on the

inside of our minds it's even more

mental in watching the interior of one's

own mind it's all sense data and

thoughts irate happy bored excited

whatever but in not one of those

sensations or thoughts will one find an

i a me obviously something is doing the

experiencing but it doesn't appear to

have a middle we can grasp or catch

sight of to bastardize a famous buddhist

story if someone asked you to show them

a plane and you did the ailerons and the

rudder and the engines and they said yes

yes but where's the plane though you'd

think that person was a few fries short

of a happy meal because a plane is just

the sum of its parts it's a bit like

that with us our buddhist friends say

there is no amount of clinging to our

names to our careers to the constant

white noise of nonsense thoughts inside

by which we will catch sight of a

tangible me of an eye and that in a very

botched way is the third mark of

existence anata we're clearly conscious

but our consciousness in buddhism

doesn't have a center not in time not in

mental space our mental selves are

constantly in flux ever-changing ever

impermanent there is a bit of a similar

sentiment in the science-y cosmological

tradition that we are star stuff that

underneath the complex recursive

storytelling machinery of our brains i

am x years old i am x feet high in x

century i am i beneath those stories

there is biology and beneath that is

chemistry and beneath that is a unity of

physics and deep time that everything is

made from we were once these then these

in a while we will be these but we were

always this and will always be this the

idea is that our identities are

incidental and clinging to them over the

majesty of the universe is wicked silly

there is no magical line between baby

and us now that we can point to and say

and then i became me it isn't so much

that we can't step in the same river

twice but with the entire world in flux

with us in flux it's that we can't even

step in the same river once

in the dharmapata the sayings of the

buddha there's the line though one may

conquer a thousand times a thousand men

in battle yet he indeed is the noblest

victor who conquers himself or herself

obviously mastery of the self it's a

neat idea and boy do we seem a long way

off from that one just daily life is

weird enough bound without security lost

without adventure wandering quietly

confused for years through the strange

cityscapes of the 21st century trying to

find yourself in it in any of it trying

to find the naive happiness of childhood

once again and is this what life is now

you think little bursts of euphoria a

few times a year drug induced or chance

induced then back to the uniform grey of

a day you won't remember and if you

should ever stick your head up above the

parapet to ask excuse me is this all

there is then only to be told to shut up

and just get on with it all the while

knowing that a star died to make you and

you no longer find romance in that all

the while being surrounded by miraculous

technology and you no longer find

romance in that the absurd ever drama of

just trying to be okay and the game gets

faster and the game gets harder more

gadgets more screens more patches and

non-stick frying pans and fiber

broadband and ultrasonic

toothbrushes and thank you for your

application but and sorry to hear you're

feeling sad but and we did everything we

could but please god make me a stone i

promised myself i'd be more than this i

promised others i'd be more than this

alive and not quite living deathly not

quite dead and all the while rages the

inner battle the great quiet attempt to

fix oneself and knowing no one else can

do it for you and that battle is hardly

limited to the individual our entire

civilization is engaged in it too on the

28th of january 1986 an o-ring failure

led to the space shuttle challenger

exploding about 72 seconds into launch

killing all seven aboard it was horrific

later news anchor tom brackel would say

of the accident the american public will

be demanding some difficult answers and

of course we'll all have to examine what

it is that we want from this era of high

technology those words were said almost

40 years ago now but they couldn't be

truer still today because it's a fairly

weird age to live in at the moment

watching the human race attempting to

protect itself from itself like a

teenager or mood swings or experimenting

with new ideologies all smashing up

mum's car and refusing to apologize in

the last 30 years about a billion people

have been lifted out of extreme poverty

which is incredible obviously but as it

stands in 2021 currently two in three

humans still live on below ten dollars a

day and one in ten on less than two

dollars a day not to mention the 800

million people who currently don't have

access to safe drinking water plus the

about 14 000 kids under five who are

dying preventable deaths every day all

of which we will all no doubt agree is

and on top of that

about 800 000 people or one copenhagen

take their own lives every year and it's

the 10th leading cause of death in the

u.s alone if there was a day just one

day every century when we all got

together to hash out what our goals

actually are as a species like top five

to do's for homo sapiens in the next

hundred years cheeky trip to nearest

star system it's on there for sure

making it a un human rights violation to

start a tinder conversation with a

single smiley face on the list

definitely but try to make sure

everyone's doing cool and like eating

and stuff no one in their right mind

would put that below number one follow

closely behind by number two when

everyone's eating and stuff let's all

work out how to be happy or at least not

living on the edge of existential

despair yet he indeed is the noblest

victor who conquers himself or rather if

we make it to the distant future where

we have warped drives and free energy or

whatever and at the very same time

hundreds of millions of us are still

living in extreme poverty that isn't

star trek that's blade runner

and except for the flying cars and cool

clothes we really don't want blade

runner the upside of all of this of

course is that it is a choice and human

problems can be solved by human beings

in the words of the much missed david

graber the ultimate hidden truth of the

world is that it is something that we

make and could just as easily make

differently

things could be a whole lot worse

things could be a whole lot better

anyway this has not been an attempt to

convert anyone to buddhism i'm not a

buddhist i'm barely a person but as an

ideology buddhism has in part probably

persisted for over two millennia now

because it points directly to questions

that are just as relevant today as they

were two millennia ago namely how can we

overcome suffering why are we always

fighting our own stupid nature and what

actually are we and the answer to a lot

of that buddhism says rather uniquely is

not up into the big transcendent but

down into the acceptance of the

impermanence of the world and into the

murk of our messy nature that liberation

salvation whatever we call it is waiting

inside the way out is down and as we

head deeper into potentially the most

dangerous century in human history this

battle of trying to regulate our bizarre

prehistoric tendencies might determine

whether we come out the other side of

this century because we're getting

wicked technological but like are we

much wiser for it you probably know the

kardashev scale already it's basically a

litmus test for categorizing how

advanced civilizations could become so a

type 1 civilization could utilize all

the energy available on its home planet

a type 2 civilization all the energy

available in its solar system and a type

3 civilization all the energy available

in its galaxy and that's all well and

good but the kardashev scale measures a

civilization's success by its energy

consumption though we could use another

metric wisdom a type 1 wisdom

civilization could have progressed to a

state where no one goes hungry where no

one needlessly dies of easily curable

diseases and everyone has at least the

same starting conditions universally on

which to try and build a life type 2

might be a civilization where no one has

to involuntarily suffer from physical or

mental maladies from chronic pain from

anxiety etc maybe where we stop

inflicting industrial scale harm on our

animal mates and keeping them in

horrific conditions but rant over i

won't go on about it and type 3 a

civilization where human animal sentient

toaster whatever doesn't have to suffer

at all with disease dead with humankind

finally liberated from the evolutionary

genetic shackles that have been tied

around our legs for millennia and if we

finally arrive at that party at the end

of time as actual adults at last as

technological bodhisattvas as masters of

our own destiny we'll hopefully spend at

least a little while marveling at just

how miraculous it was that we managed to

live through an era in which we could

land robots on other planets and

simultaneously still didn't quite know

how to be happy or properly take care of

all the human family yet and if we make

it to that party together as a species

that would be way cool yo i'm hella

stoked for that yo i trust you are too

yo

but until then

well

until then

so

until then

and until then

and until

until then


Title: so you want to build a nuke - YouTube - English.txt
so you want to build a nuke eh well

for that you need some uranium uranium

is a radioactive element

it has many uses including curing cancer

generating power

and making people immediately stop

existing anyway

once you've mined some uranium you'll

need to enrich it why

because isotopes if you vary the

neutrons in an element you get different

cosplay versions

of that element and the version we want

here is uranium-235

because it's good in bonds and  so

it's off to the centrifuges for some

wizzy fun time and soon you'll have

shiny apocalypse cookies before you can

say nuclear holocaust

and if you're still serious about

building this thing we'll need to talk

about fission

and fusion thanks to this smoking hot

piece of physicist booty we now know you

can make a little bit of mass

into a lot of energy and one way of

doing that is via

fission fission is when you give big

atomic nuclei a bonk and convert them

into smaller nuclei

and you get loads of energy from that

it's how nuclear reactors work and also

bombs fusion is the reverse of that

basically when nuclei combine

it's how the sun works and also bombs in

a fission bomb the goal is to get the

uranium to release neutrons

one can do this via explosives or

claiming to have engaged in sexual

intercourse with the uranium's mother

these neutrons will hit the unstable

nuclei of the rest of the uranium

and at that point well whatever argument

it was that led you to detonate this

thing

let's just say you won that one but if

you're really pissed

off then you'll need a fusion bomb this

is a double whammy

the first stage is fission then switches

to fusion creating essentially

a star on earth anyway that's your nuke

built so it's off to the races baby

well we'll need somewhere quiet to test

it out how's about somewhere near the

hornado de nueto desert in new mexico

lovely little spot for a picnic make

sure to bring some jam

those little triangular sandwiches and a

crippling certainty that thanks to you

humankind will forevermore be held

hostage

by itself the first ever nuclear device

is detonated on july 16th 1945

codename trinity the device explodes

with the equivalent power of 22 000 tons

of tnt later robert oppenheimer the

father of the atomic bomb

will say i remember the line from the

hindu scripture

the baha'i vagita now i am become death

the destroyer of worlds just under a

month later the b-29 and nola gay will

drop the fish and bomb little boy

over the japanese city of hiroshima it

will explode with the power of 15 000

tons

of tnt above will preside a mushroom

cloud

60 000 feet high below 70 000 people

are immediately incinerated and

mutilated by a shock wave traveling

faster than the speed of sound

thousands of people who are not killed

in the initial blast will be exposed to

ionizing radiation

suffering the effects for decades to

come hemorrhaging

cancer and genetic mutations three days

later

a second bomb called fat man will be

dropped on the seaport of nagasaki

at least 60 000 people will be killed

japan will surrender three weeks later

and the governments of the world will

almost unanimously agree

that this must never happen again not

intentionally

not by accident not by ignorance

in 1947 the bulletin of the atomic

scientists devised a doomsday

clock with midnight representing

absolute global catastrophe

today the clock stands at 100 seconds to

midnight

pretty bad but frankly it's hard to see

what they're getting their little lab

coats in a twist about eh

world war ii was ages ago the threat of

nuclear war is long gone

other than wow okay in 1961

several four megaton nukes might have

slightly fallen out of a b-52 over north

carolina

one of which narrowly avoided

destinating because of a single safety

switch

but okay other than that well in 1962 a

soviet patrol submarine might have

slightly lost contact with the land

the captain assuming world war iii had

already started and was about to fire a

10

kiloton nuke torpedo at a nearby u.s

fleet before the flotilla commander

could calm him down

and maybe 1967 when a solar flare took

out a few norad radars the us might have

slightly freaked out and almost launched

a bomber counter-strike against the

soviet union

then 1969 north korea shot down a u.s

radar surveillance plane president

richard nixon allegedly drunk gave the

order for a nuclear strike in

retaliation

luckily henry kissinger stepped in and

we're still here

or just the entire cold war basically 40

years of unrelenting nuclear panic

and then you remember the precarious

state of mutually assured destruction

which is well when a mummy country and a

daddy country hate each other very much

sometimes they get embroiled in a

nuclear standoff and

one little deterrent against pushing the

button is the knowledge that in the time

it takes for your missiles to reach your

enemy

your enemy will have kindly fired theirs

back at you the idea

is that if you're rational neither of

you are going to strike first

until you remember that humans are not

rational we are i believe the

anthropological term is

morons currently nine countries

have nukes that's the us

russia france my homeland of crumpets

and self-hate pakistan

india israel the uppity korea and of

course china

and that's not to mention several

countries probably have hypersonic

nuclear missiles now

which can fly upwards of five times the

speed of sound

rendering modern missile defense systems

about as effective as putting up a

little sign that says

ah don't newcast mate you said you

wouldn't what are you doing you said you

wouldn't why are you oh for  sake

you're such a dick

or rather if these puppies launch in the

words of the motto of the us postal

service

neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom

of night shall stay these couriers from

swift completion of their appointed

rounds

it's a hundred seconds to midnight baby

nuclear armageddon

ain't gone anywhere the cold war ended

in 91 but the real war the silent war

has only just started because we

discovered a 23rd century technology in

the 20th century and we're too primitive

for this ship right now

and ironically nukes are so prevalent in

entertainment and media that we've

almost forgotten this is real that if we

aren't constantly vigilant apocalypse

could happen any time and it will be the

end of

everything including possibly the only

instance of life anywhere in the

universe

all just because of some mental general

or  dictator

as einstein allegedly said i know not

with what weapons world war 3 will be

fought

but world war 4 will be fought with

sticks and stones

anyway have a lovely week won't you


Title: 8 Million Species of Aliens - YouTube - English.txt
language is weird and swearing is maybe

the weirdest thing we do with it oh most

words are fine avocado sasketch one

amphibian dog entity but use these other

words and suddenly it's all uh sir this

is a funeral that's not appropriate

language also why are you wearing that

dinosaur costume also please stop openly

taking schedule 1 substances during the

reading of the eulogy

jesus we may as well start with perhaps

the ultimate naughty mouth noise which

we'll just substitute with the german

philosopher kant in a futile attempt to

avoid youtube demonetization the words

can't roots are probably germanic we

don't know how the word got started but

we do know that the strength of the word

has changed over time

chaucer used a cousin word quaint openly

in the 14th century shakespeare was

writing puns with it in the 17th century

and today like many swears it functions

as the lowest insult and at the same

time the highest compliment in many

parts of the world one might be called a

stupid cat but in australia he's a right

good cat is tall praise indeed same goes

for he's the  just remove the

definite article and the meaning is

exactly the opposite likewise bollocks

can mean false information or the dog's

bollocks something brilliant then

there's  the beloved old faithful of

the english tongue it probably comes

from germanic or indo-european possibly

for to strike and it is flexible it can

function as an adjective is that a

penguin as an adverb this

penguin is  unhinged yo

intransitive verb this penguin  or

even as a verbal noun that penguin has

an assault rifle i think we're about to

receive quite the  and judging by

the fact that official documents from

the middle ages mention gentlemen with

names such as the upstanding john

lefucker we can guess that like the word

can't  probably wasn't always as

strong as it is today anyway words don't

just change in severity but they also

mutate to be nice once meant to be

foolish to amuse meant to deceive then

there's toilet a noun borrowed from the

middle french word twal meaning a little

piece of cloth next it came to mean the

cloth that covers a dressing table then

the things on the dressing table then

the dressing table itself then the whole

process of getting ready for the day and

then morphed into its current form the

disgustatorium we know and love in any

case cursing and insults probably work

not because of the sound of the words

themselves but because they are

metaphors if you screw up and the

serbian person tells you you just

the hedgehogs back it's clearly not that

you literally crippled a poor hedgehog

but that you are in general regrettably

an idiot likewise in latin calling

someone a public poop pile clearly just

meant they were worthless or in russian

if someone threatens you with me i'm

gonna show you where the crayfish

hibernates really of course they just

mean actually i have no idea with this

one but sounds good doesn't it and some

languages don't even really have

profanity but the one we're speaking in

now does it is a technology it is a gift

because the real genius of our species

is in language and the genius of

language is in cursing and it's more

complicated than that because to even

get that some words are bad in the first

place you have to understand register

phonology semantics all of which we're

doing all day every day automatically

right now in fact meaning get a load of

you 10 out of 10 no notes you're a

linguistic primate whatever happens even

if everything's gone to  even if

you're miserably listening to this in

the bath drinking vodka and shampoo

because you ran out of mixers you have

the superpower of language meaning golly

g you are doing one hecking success

are you drinking your mother's shampoo

again

dad

shut the  up if you're listening to

this then congratulations you've already

acquired a language but of course none

of us remember doing it really new

humans usually spend a large amount of

their time vocalizing meaningless

nonsense some people continue this far

past infancy it's called babbling even

fresh out of the oven we're already

trying to talk then between 9 and 18

months usually come our first words in

english generally mama dada or oh god i

exist make it stop by year two most of

us have at least 150 words licked and by

three we will simply not shut up then

most of us will go on to nail the four

main aspects of wordy noises phonology

that's the sound of speech semantics

that's vocabulary and meaning grammar

and syntax learning how words fit

together and pragmatics knowing what's

even appropriate to say and when and

just as children acquire language

presumably civilization had to too too

what please permit this stock image of a

confused llama to signify we don't know

so did language first begin in our

hunter-gatherer past as just simple

nouns

and what was the first language well

tamil is the oldest living language

thousands of years old even and still

spoken by about 80 million people today

but again bruh and did an enlargening of

the human brain make language possible

or did language encourage enlargements

of the brain

evolution is sociopathic but it isn't

usually wasteful so what problem did our

distant ancestors have to solve that was

so complicated we had to evolve not just

simple verbal communication but the

capacity to memorize and use thousands

and thousands of words why did our

ancestors need the ability to say uh

homies i don't mean to be egregious but

is that a rather sizable apex predator

over there rather than just ah  lion

maybe it was for negotiation maybe

for laying down sick diss tracks we have

no idea then again we don't even know

where we yawn yet so you know baby steps

still if we stick with english for now

we do know a fair bit just like greek

hindi catalan and many other languages

english has its roots in

proto-indo-european

a language we've had to reconstruct

probably spoken about 6 000 years ago by

a bunch of cats who lived between the

black sea and the caspian sea through a

combination of the standard human

pastimes of wandering around and

shagging each other language families

probably grew out of proto-indo-european

germanic began to evolve then came

anglo-frisian old english middle english

and finally the patchwork tongue we're

using now and just 10 seconds of

watching what you're saying in english

will reveal what a patchwork tongue it

is do you like waffles what is do doing

there exactly you like waffles or i know

like waffles is not only more efficient

it's the structure plenty of other

languages use perfectly well or o-u-g-h

which can be used simultaneously to

spell do cough bow through and if you're

learning english at the moment i'm just

so sorry we don't get it either in fact

english is one of the only languages

that can have competitions for spelling

many languages can't do this it's too

easy because they use phonetic spelling

because they're not  mental yukt

descent choreograph english stop it get

some help and it's kinda telling that

once indoctrinated into english is

madness if someone breaks the rules we

know even if we can't explain what the

rule is this sentence now become loads

weird syntax because all jumble ryan

reynolds or the fact that in english

descriptions generally have to go

opinion size age shape color origin

material purpose noun and only in that

order or we get upset a lovely big new

blue fluffy polyester cap bed is fine a

polyester blue catbed lovely big new

fluffy strongly suggests those thc

gummies have just kicked in hard or

register which is basically knowing

which words to use in the context of

communicating there are a few registers

in english but let's just say we're

usually talking formally or informally

and it's not always obvious which

register to use you may have found

yourself in one of those

interviews with a hey we're all friends

at the company vibe where they insist

you speak your mind and just be honest

but if they ask what you do for fun and

as requested you reply honestly well in

my free time i like smoking massive

rocks of crack cocaine

i'd say my biggest weakness is

perfectionism it is highly unlikely you

will be offered the position but

arguably the most interesting feature of

almost all languages is displacement or

rather we can talk about things

somewhere else in time and space none of

us will live to see it but we can have a

chat about paris in 500 years or

patagonia 500 years ago likewise you're

not here but i can tell you it's

currently 1am in europe i'm sat in front

of two monitors with a word document and

a beer the cat is sleeping on the desk

the light is fairly dim and you probably

imagined something like this which

doesn't sound like a remarkable skill

but it is it's literally telepathy it's

mind-reading because language

isn't just for pointing it is the ether

in which we distribute abstractions it's

possible without words even there's no

official name for an ellipsis followed

by a question mark but the meaning is

universally understood as uh what the

and the fact that we immediately

get this tells us that humans have

evolved way past the era of pointing and

entered into the age of signification

and metaphor things mean deeper things

sometimes was captain oates just going

for a walk was moby dick just about a

whale are those baby on board signs just

about the baby on board and if you

happen to be the sort of person who

likes to blow off a little steam by

indiscriminately careening into other

motor vehicles at top speed but you

suddenly notice this sign would you

avoid that car for some reason or is the

purpose of the sign really just to tell

you that the people driving the car

successfully boned at least once we get

it you reproduced well done etc etc etc

this is messier 13. it's a fairly

cramped globular galaxy about 25 000

light years away and in 1974 we detected

this signal coming from messier 13. the

signal is composed of frequency

modulated radio waves shifting by 10

hertz and out of this you get ones and

zeros that correspond to

1679 digits which is weird because

that's a semi-prime a number divisible

by itself one and two other prime

numbers 23 and 73. so you arrange the

ones and zeros on a grid 23 by 73

squares and you get these shapes it's

hard to imagine this is from a natural

astronomical event but if it's a message

it's even harder to imagine what it

means because i'm playing of course this

is a message we sent to messier 13 not

the other way around but it bears

hammering home that if we want to

establish contacts with intelligent life

beyond earth not to imply there's any on

earth universal messages are going to be

like really tricky the messier 13 signal

we sent is called the arecibo message

and it looks in full like this there are

seven components first is a primer the

numbers one to ten in binary then some

representations of human dna then an

approximation of us and our population

then our solar system and which planet

it is sending the message earth then the

aracebo radio telescope that sent the

message itself the message only has

another oh 24 955 years to go before

arriving but when it does and if it

reaches messier 13 in about 12 more

jesus cycles it's gonna be a bit of a

doozy to decode because we're assuming

in the first place that aliens will

understand that this is binary or

whatever their analog of binary is next

that the messier thirteeners will know

this is dna or that they even understand

nucleotide biology then that they will

ensure this is an organism not a

structure or a continent then that this

is a solar system not an appendage or a

reproductive organ or something and then

that this is a machine and that's all

assuming they even use symbolic language

in the first place to be fair the

message was more sent ceremonially than

a real hello but still when you think

about it how do you send an unambiguous

message to beings of unknown psychology

well it's bad enough with us there are a

fair few writing systems by our own

species that we still can't decipher

like bible script in lebanon or linear a

in crete and that's not to mention

nuclear semiotics which is the study of

well we produce a lot of nuclear waste

and the stuff we don't recycle need

somewhere to go because it's hella

dangerous and it stays dangerous for

thousands of years oh well we'll put it

somewhere then okay but in the hardly

implausible event that civilization

collapses entirely and say in the

distant future our great great great

great grandchildren discover our sights

full of nuclear waste we need some way

of telling them this radioactive stuff

will make you dead don't put it up your

bottom and if today's languages are

forgotten by them how do you write that

warning without words oh that's easy

just yeah really because that could mean

death it could also just be a drum kit

depending on how morbid your culture is

or okay how about this so left to right

that's obvious yeah unless they read

right to left like literally millions of

humans do today in which case it isn't

so much the nuclear waste kills you

rather that it brings you back from the

dead oh but it's obvious there's

arrows yeah what does an arrow mean if

you've never seen an actual arrow and on

top of that even if we crack universal

messaging even if aliens receive and

read our nonsense would they care we are

the way we are because of evolutionary

pressure because of our specific climb

up the tree of life we could have ended

up looking a thousand other ways perhaps

we could have ended up thinking a

thousand other ways is it universal for

other intelligent species in the

universe to be curious or linguistic or

social or even give a damn about looking

across the knights for other mines who

knows but we're trying to find them and

the aracebo message is hardly the only

message we've sent to the heavens

between april 2051 and november 2069 the

human sent message cosmic call 1 will be

arriving in the constellation cygnus and

sejita respectively between july 2047

and february 2017 the teenage message

will make its way to the constellations

ursa major cassiopeia and a few others

then cosmic call 2 hello from earth and

a bunch more whether received or not in

transit currently are our first tries

hello our name is our fledgling

electromagnetic attempts to introduce

ourselves to the great neighborhood but

even then even if those messages reach

other beings even if those beings

understand what they're reading

considering just how young we are

technologically it is entirely possible

that more advanced civilizations may

well perceive us as babies still stuck

at our early vocalization stage babbling

at adults as those adults silently wait

for us to begin the quests of learning

cosmic grammar as we continue like

featherless birds chirping desperately

across the dark forests

talking of which perhaps you've been to

one of these fancy international meetups

that capital cities like arranging

sometimes and the native speakers of

widely used languages will usually seek

each other out and the brits and the

americans will inevitably start

chuckling amongst themselves at the tiny

differences in their vocabulary oh you

say trunk we say boot oh you say cause

light we say horse piss etc while just a

few feet away will be standing someone

who uses a completely different system

of writing and grammar someone from

georgia or tibet or wherever who won't

be receiving anywhere near as much

attention for some reason someone who

genuinely has linguistic differences

just look at georgian he's gorgeous it's

georgious but when it comes to language

we seem to be fascinated with similar

differences not different similars which

is maybe why for all of our looking out

to the stars for talking aliens we seem

a little indifferent about the fact that

aliens are sort of already here and

there's about eight million species of

them

this apprentice chunker is called freya

she's four years old she likes tuna and

when she's really chill she presents the

jelly beans for inspection freya has

never uttered a word before but she does

sort of say things to me especially when

she's hungry

you already have food what's this or

rather she's probably saying i want

something make you do thing i want you

bipedal furless oik if communication is

trying to put things from your head into

other heads then this is kind of

communication and though her and i share

a common ancestor and though we both

enjoy idleness and biographical dramas

her mind is pretty unknowable to me and

i'm quite sure her reality is unknowable

to me too if this little lion could

speak i would not understand her sort of

talking aliens are already here i live

with a sort of talking alien perhaps you

do too oh but she's not a talking

intelligent alien you might reply well

first of all what'd you say about my cat

you and second of all all right

then how's about ants

well there's probably about a hundred

trillion of them on earth made up of

twelve thousand species they form

alliances raid other colonies and

practice division of labor just like us

working as nurses foragers warriors

matey with a door for a head matey has a

door for a head and they build societies

of a sort one colony in japan reportedly

held 300 million of the suckers made of

45 000 nests across 700 acres about the

same size as mark zuckerberg's hawaiian

estate a thriving metropolis and how

with communication with sound touch and

chemical cues pheromones ant pheromones

can signal anything from alarm there's

an intruder to i done a good trail come

see even to propaganda pheromones lying

about allegiances to get inside other

nests oh but those aren't talking

intelligent aliens either you might say

that's just mindless group cooperation

yeah could one of us build a space

program or an airliner or even a pencil

all by ourselves we look like ants from

not that far up but all right how about

bees then if you're having a lovely day

out as a honey bee and you come upon

some nectar you'll want to tell your

mates so it's back to the hive where you

perform this figure eight dance in which

you'll communicate the richness of the

nectar with the intensity of your twerk

and the location of the nectar with the

direction of your dance relative to the

sun it's called the waggle dance is that

language uh it depends how you feel

about bodria after a few drinks but

either way we'll never know because the

non-human communication story ends there

with insects unfortunately

except of course it  doesn't what

about electric fish who use their

electric fields to chat about anything

from hi i'm a boyfish or a girlfish to

we're getting attacked as simultaneously

they're trailed by sharks who have

learned to eavesdrop on these electrical

conversations or dolphins who some

researchers think are naming themselves

with entirely unique whistles rather

impressive if true considering most of

us don't even have an original christian

name or cuttlefish who can display two

totally different messages on either

sides of their bodies simultaneously or

elephants who seem to be sending seismic

distress signals with their stamps that

can travel tens of miles distantly

through the ground or chimpanzees who

can learn and utilize hundreds of

symbols from human sign language it's

debatable whether they really understand

what they're saying but in any case they

can not only count with human numbers

but can outperform humans over and over

at memorizing number sequences or of

course to humpback whales and their

songs the songs are usually hierarchical

units build into phrases which build

into themes which build into songs they

compose and exchange these songs

together inside populations many songs

are only sung during breeding season so

something to do with getting laid but

many aren't sometimes they're used

before feeding sometimes just alone and

why do they sing at all we have no idea

but if the criteria for an alien we're

interested in is can do some technology

and communication has mind we don't

understand and evolved from beyond earth

many animals are nailing two out of

three of these and to the third one

there our last common ancestor with

parrots lived probably 300 million years

ago five times as far back as the

dinosaurs went extinct our last common

link with octopuses is likely about

twice that 750 million years back

animals might not be from an alien

planet but many are certainly from an

alien time which is not to say that

animals will be rivaling humans any time

soon they're busy with their own

often literally but until

extraterrestrials message us back if

it's different similars we're looking

for if it's unknowable minds we're after

haven't they been here the whole time

and is the problem really that they're

not smart enough to speak our languages

or that we're currently too daft to

understand theirs

it's got a door

if you were choosing a house and one was

open plan had picturesque views 57

million square miles of land five oceans

a breathable atmosphere and meerkats and

the other house was a barren hellscape

with poisonous soil a poisonous

atmosphere a constant barrage of deadly

cosmic radiation and zero mere cats

i mean you'd pick the nice one right

because you spent millions of years

evolving to live there and there's land

galore and plenty of resources and if

you treat it properly it could be a

veritable paradise with humans and

nature living in perfect heart where the

are you going

but if you really insist on visiting

mars then we'll have to get there so

spacey school first where you'll be

treated to a variety of psychologists in

your brain and a variety of cameras up

your ass then a ride up through the

atmosphere on a barely controlled

explosion bomb voyage

off we go then unless your spaceship

uses spinny sci-fi rings welcome to zero

gravity meaning you can now look forward

to space adaptation syndrome or science

your precious bodily fluids will now

redistribute and puff your head up your

lunch will probably pop out of your

tummy for a second viewing your spine

will now begin to stretch out by a few

centimeters let's see how that goes when

you get back to gravity and maybe

debilitating kidney stones from your

bones losing calcium and cancerous

radiation from cosmic rays we are not

made for space on average mars is about

142 million miles from earth but every

26 months it gets close enough for

humans to pop across traveling with

current tech that'll probably take

around seven months and during that time

all of your food will be eaten from bags

no booze obviously and let's just hope

you like drinking recycled pierce as the

nasa motto goes today's coffee is

because confinement you now inescapably

share a double decker bus with a bunch

for the next seven months on top of that

is little oodle doodles on a black

background interspersed with occasional

breaks for a nice cup of piss java on

top of that medical problems dental

issues unexpected space pregnancy the

nearest hospital is millions of miles

back the way you came but assuming

you've avoided technical failure

psychological failure deadly

micrometeoroids hopefully you've made it

to mars pick a nice spot for landing and

prepare for 10 minutes of terror even

though the atmosphere of mars is about

100 times less dense than earth's that

means it's enough to burn stuff up but

not thick enough to make parachutes very

effective you'll need some variation of

an aeroshell to protect the spacecraft

booty a parachute to slow things down a

bit and probably retro rockets to get to

the surface undead and if you still

haven't gone mad sad or irradiated and

you sat down alright best of luck

standing up you've just got used to zero

gravity and now gravity is back the

world will go 10 tequila shots wibbly

with your eyes fighting your vestibular

system your body thinks it's been

poisoned vertigo and horrific nausea

could go on for weeks but if you can

power through snap a blueprint on the

martian surface for us idiots back home

10 points to gryffindor humanity has

gone interplanetary that's one small

step for a suicidal astronaut one giant

leap for whoever happens to be into big

barren balls of sweet

all

because that's where you are now

great you've made the history books but

that ain't gonna keep you alive now

maybe some robots went ahead of you and

got a little crib ready maybe not but

either way you'll need your own

breathable air because mars don't have

that mars's atmosphere is 95 carbon

dioxide that's the stuff we breathe out

not in three percent nitrogen or plant

food you are not a plant and two percent

ago argon now maybe you can make oxygen

from carbon dioxide using a process

called electrolysis but that is going to

take lots of power and unless you

brought a nuclear reactor with you or

something good luck anyway duties of

yours will probably include scouting the

area for prime real estate for those who

come after you a spot of geology

geography and trying not to die and get

a load of your new hood the tallest

volcano in the solar system olympus mons

the largest canyon in the solar system

valles marineris and hope your beach

body is ready because maximum

temperature is 30 degrees celsius hope

your beach coffin is ready because

minimum is -140

a mars day is only 37 minutes longer

than ours there'll also be four seasons

just like earth and feel free to step

outside and die in any of them oh watch

out for dust storms they can get 20

miles high and spread across the entire

planet for months on end the greeks

called mars's two moons fear and panic

and there's a reason for that

now we think there's still frozen water

on mars maybe liquid water deep under

the surface hopefully you found some of

that and hopefully it isn't full of

deadly lurking pathogens talking of

which old martian water might mean old

martian life and how exciting if you

found some of that possibly yeah

possibly  no because if the remains

of life are found there's two

possibilities either we confirm that

it's an ancient ancestor of earth life

meaning somehow we swapped microbes with

mars ages ago and we're all descended

from the same stuff interesting for sure

or there's no connection to earth

meaning it's really real alien life and

one massive thing we don't know about

the universe is how common is life just

arising in the first place well if the

remains of alien life even microbes are

found on mars that means life began

independently on two out of eight

planets in our solar system alone or one

in four pretty good odds and if we apply

those odds to the rest of the universe

there are probably at least thousands of

earth-like planets in our galaxy alone

billions considering all the other

galaxies and that's nice and that's

swell but if life is so common where is

everyone then where is anyone well maybe

alien life doesn't evolve into complex

organisms very often or maybe it does

but civilizations wipe themselves out

with some technology waiting for us a

few hundred years into our own future or

maybe someone is meticulously wiping

them out something to rustle the

existential jimmies in any case still

your launch window will come around in a

few months off your trot the next lot of

human parasites to arrive might start

thinking about actually sticking around

for a while as in permanent digs and for

them radiation will be a big issue

courtesy of the sun and cosmic rays all

things being equal humans on mars would

receive 50 times as much radiation as

they would living on earth lava tubes

could be an idea they're underground

that'll help there might be some decent

ones at a spot called halas planeta for

example and if humans can seal a section

off and pressurize it and with the help

of a nuclear reactor oxygen extraction

from the atmosphere etc yeah maybe

alternately mars is covered in crushed

rock regolith everywhere we don't know

yet if you can make durable concrete

from the stuff would be neat for

building with but again radiation so

some kind of protective shell would be

needed if humans are living up top and

covering everything in a layer of

regolith might do the trick for

shielding solar and cosmic nasties in

any case underground overground wombling

free if humans can find enough power

water and protection from radiation it

won't be pretty living but maybe for

whatever god forsaken reason anyone

would live on mars it could be home

now making babies on mars will not be a

problem there's enough gravity for that

having babies though

god knows what happens to a developing

fetus on mars if conception is even

possible but this is all made up anyway

so assuming radiation hasn't damaged the

mum or child during gestation

congratulations it's a martian the first

one ever and just by being born he or

she will perhaps instantly become one of

the most famous humans ever to exist

talk about peaking early now mars is

unlikely to be a state by then so if

maritime law applies he or she will

probably inherit the citizenship of

their parents all the same the first

ever native martian will no doubt be

adorable in that irritating baby way

tiny feetsies tiny hands but with bones

and a heart that will develop in martian

gravity just 38

of earth's they may never be able to

visit earth not without some miraculous

technology our gravity will be

exhausting possibly fatal but if you're

of a certain age you know what happens

when one of your mates has a baby

suddenly everyone wants one resource

permitting here come more little

martians then living effectively in a

submarine is all they will know and

they'll be told stories of course of

another planet just over there somewhere

with oceans and zebras and skyscrapers

all beneath a benevolent blue sky this

will also probably signal a change in

the colony from survivalists to

homesteaders they need teachers now and

pediatricians and pharmacologists to

cook up whatever brand of liquid

morphine it is that stops new parents

going  postal they're

generational they're a proper settlement

and hopefully with enough fertilizer and

detoxification martian soil can support

a crop yield to foster a growing

population who knows and what do

martians do all day anyway why would

earth have funded a martian operation

for so long it really depends on what we

find there if rare resources are

abundant mining and export could be an

option mars has less than half the

gravity of earth and if rocket fuel can

be made in abundance interplanetary

logistics mars to earth would be way

cheaper than the other way around

asteroid mining also wouldn't be the

worst idea if we're going all sci-fi

between jupiter and mars is our solar

system's main asteroid belt it's only

about four percent the mass of earth's

moon but full of iron and nickel cobalt

vibranium billions and billions of

dollars worth of materials and

considering mars is closer and again

easier to launch stuff into orbit from

could be the basis of an economy maybe

but whatever happens next really depends

on whether martians can achieve energy

independence from earth if they're

forever relying on us for isotopes or

materials they'll forever be a satellite

of the mother planet if they don't have

to though that would be interesting

because they're 20 minutes away by radio

and months away by rocket and if you

leave isolated settlers in one place

they do what humans always do culture

inventing new dialects new traditions

and with that a sense of independent

martian solidarity they probably have

their own flag and catchy anthems about

how mars is best this planet perhaps

they'll start having little chats

amongst themselves about how they're

getting bored with the earth supervision

thing but we know what happens when a

distant state or multinational has an

isolated group of people just where it

wants them and the issue of independence

gets raised the reply from corporate

usually goes something like listen you

just keep doing or producing or

exporting whatever it is of yours we

like so much and in return you'll be

more than fairly compensated with a tea

break once a year and pitifully small

payment if any at all and even more

brutal working conditions and if you

don't like it feel free to eat that big

bag of dicks over there and every now

and then if sufficiently irate perhaps

these isolated people respond thanks

that sounds great small digression

though about the tea it's lovely with

lemon but yeah we prefer it in the

boston harbour yeah  15 bucks

little man pay us fair and insert your

resolute trading company right up your

fundament we want meerkats and passports

and  loads of meerkats we'll found

our own martian government with our own

parliamentary shouty people and

everything and we'll do democracy better

we'll do brutality better we'll

everything up better than you ever could

no one's had a bath in three generations

so take your quarterly reports and your

taxation without representation and

right off yep ocean hogging atmosphere

breathing cuts

they grow up so fast

about three billion years ago when the

human race was a mere twinkle in

darwin's eye it's likely that mars had

an ocean over time the planetary core

cooled and the great magnet at the heart

of the world shut down and without a

magnetic field for protection solar

winds began to attack stripping away the

atmosphere while the water below was

evaporated as life flourished next door

for 3000 million years but if we make

the trip there sometime soon though the

first settlers to mars may arrive in

hell they would surely prefer eden can

we do that can we bring a planet back

from the dead

well no probably not us we're barely

managing the house we grew up in but our

kids kids kids might give it a go if the

technology is there for starters they

would need to recreate mars's long dead

magnetic field its magnetosphere and one

fun and pleasantly insane idea for this

is engineering a taurus or donut of

plasma around the planet by firing off

particles from phobos mars's larger moon

but this stuff is all probably science

for later this century or the next and

even with magnetic shielding the

atmosphere is thinner than airline

toilet paper and too chilly for humans

anyway well a bit of global warming then

co2 and cfcs are terrible for our

atmosphere but released into mars

atmosphere by the kiloton would be one

way to thicken and warm things up but

even then if the air is nice and toasty

we still can't breathe it cyanobacteria

gifted earth with oxygen via

photosynthesis but that took millions

and millions of years even if

cyanobacteria is capable of living on

mars or genetically engineered algae or

something making mars air breathable

with photosynthesis is likely to take

centuries if not a millennium if not

longer though if it's possible perhaps

as back on earth we grimly mark the

successive milestones of environmental

decline our martian cousins will watch

their world for the opposite

the first cloud the first reigns the

first blade of grass and anthill the

first lover's picnic outside the first

martian generation to consider

themselves not as stalwart settlers but

earth's equals full terraforming may

just not be possible some areas of

science are dead ends there's a reason

alchemy jobs are so hard to come by

these days but from our current vantage

point in history there is a case for the

possibility of resurrecting mars and

wherever else humans of the solar system

go whatever else we turn into however

much better or worse human existence

becomes with any kind of permanent

self-sufficient settlement on mars a

single delicate cell of planetary

civilization will have divided in two

with the terrible burden of cosmic

survival carried on two backs now making

the weight lighter for both

there's a good bit near the end of the

movie 2010 when the story is almost

wrapped up and non-corporeal omnipotent

aliens deign to communicate with

humanity just once a message addressed

to all of us

and paraphrased the message reads

all these worlds are yours

use them together

use them

in peace

hi thanks for staying until the bitter

end i wrote a story a while ago called

geometry for ocelots and just a mere

year after the ebook came out it's a

paperback now too there's a link below

if you want to get hold of the paperback

there's a link below if you don't it

works equally well as a doorstop a

beverage mat and perhaps a tarpaulin for

any itinerant mice passing through your

premises it's a thousand-year long war

between a religious empire and a

scientific empire really but with

buddhism and transhumanism along for the

ride sorry it took a while to get into

prince but of all the stories i've

written this is

one of them anyway i hope you enjoy it i

hope you're keeping well i hope your gut

bacteria are in good health i hope you

recently enjoyed a game of backgammon i

hope you're on the verge of emerging

from a personal crisis i hope the air

temperature is optimal wherever you

happen to be on the planet i hope you

found your purpose in life i hope you've

worked out what was in the briefcase in

pulp fiction i hope you recently

encountered a cat


Title: How the Frogs Cooked Dinner - YouTube - English.txt
one day a scorpion wanted to cross a

river so it approached a frog for help

i'd like to the frog said but if i let

you get on my back you'll sting me of

course i wouldn't the scorpion said that

would only kill us both and so the frog

let the scorpion onto its back they swam

out onto the river once they reached the

middle of the river the scorpion stand

the frog the frog called out why did you

do that now we'll both die it's in my

nature the scorpion said as they both

began to slip below the water bound for

muddy graves on the bottom of that dark

riverbed that neither cheered nor

commiserated nor delighted in the slings

and arrows of the amoral unit hold up

there forefront the frog said the frog

had been up all night at a frankfurt

rave and was still so full of disco

biscuits that his system could fight off

the poison for a few moments longer you

must be very wise if you're so aware of

your own impulses like that you bet the

scorpion said and you must be very

clever and worldly if you lied to me

like that my intellectuals are german my

lingerie is french the scorpion said

then how come you're not clever and wise

enough to realize you can resist your

own nature why would i want to the

scorpion asked because you haven't just

killed me you've killed yourself you

could have waited 20 seconds then stung

me when we got back to land ah the

scorpion said that this was guaranteed

to work you can't blame me for being a

profiteer it's the main character of

scorpions no it isn't the frog said you

just so lacking character that the only

thing you know how to do is ruin the

efforts of others and kill yourself in

the process the scorpion lit a cigarette

as they continue to sink and said eh and

you know the frog said the most

insulting part isn't that you've done

something stupid it's that you've done

something stupid and you're so afraid of

just apologizing that you've concocted

an entire infantile ad-hoc belief system

around your own shortcomings full of

enough cognitive dissonance to make the

trojan horse blush you think you're

clever trying to convince everyone that

profiteering off greed is the way of the

world but you're dumb because you don't

even realize you're dependent on the

rest of us for there to even be things

to profiteer off of ah the scorpion said

either you die a hero or live long

enough to become the no the frog said

the world isn't fundamentally unfair the

world isn't anything it's just full of

creatures that make it so you're the

problem convincing yourself everything

is futile just so you can give them to

your cynical zero-sum game impulses

which you could choose to assess and

discard at any time and then things

wouldn't be unfair idiocy is passive it

takes a special kind of idiot to inflict

their idiocy on someone else the

scorpion considered this then said

you  you said the frog  you said

the scorpion no  you said the frog

no  you said the scorpion

you no  you said the frog we're

all selfish sometimes but most of us are

ashamed of it we don't make selfishness

of virtue in some cheap attempt to trick

the only idiots who believe that kind of

nonsense just so we can take a few more

spoils from the world for ourselves i

didn't even want to be in a fable i

applied for a greek paradox but they

only take cute animals now i have to get

remembered for this  what's even the

moral put up with vicious idiots who

want to ruin the world they can't help

it how is that my fault just apologize

and i'll forgive you even now even at

the end oh i never apologize the

scorpion said why because it's not in my

nature the frog slipped beneath the

water it gave a few desperate gasps then

died the scorpion slipped beneath the

water and did not die because scorpions

can survive for up to 48 hours

underwater it was so stupid it didn't

realize it could have gotten over the

river by itself it watched the frog's

motionless body a while on the riverbed

and meditated on death and futility and

wondered if it should feel responsible

for all this it thought to itself and

how can frogs die better than facing

fearful odds for the ashes of their

fathers and the temples of their gods

which wasn't the scorpion's line but it

would tell everyone that it was on

balance it decided not a bad day a

number of frogs had been watching the

scene and were waiting for the scorpion

when it waddled back out of the water

why did you do that they asked it's in

my nature the scorpion said wait one

frog said we're altruists this is a new

concept to us what do you mean ah the

scorpion said you can't blame a creature

for reckless egotism if it's just what

they do the frogs pondered this whose

fault is it then uh the scorpion said

everyone else is for being compassionate

of course they're the real problem in

the animal kingdom why this changes

everything the frog said we'll switch to

the new paradigm immediately as a thank

you for this revelation would you like

to join us for dinner so we can discuss

guiltless self-interest further in fact

bring all your friends incapable of

practicing kindness but more than happy

to take it from others the scorpion and

its many associates accepted the

invitation that evening the frogs

prepared a delicious meal of olives and

bread and wine and cheese and every

scorpion in the forest roasted over a

massive fire


Title: Don&#39;t Hex the Water - YouTube - English.txt
on the mountain is the Eternal City of

anteriori the place where there are no

secrets and while the citizens do not

smile so much they hardly frown either

jewels and objects of great worth lie in

the streets for there is no theft where

there are no secrets and there are no

secrets in anteriori long ago during the

war of magical technology the city

sheltered a great wizard and in return

for the city's kindness the wizard

Enchanted the water of interior such

that one need only stare into the

reflection of a puddle or wash basin and

ask after a personal Place one should

like to see and be shown that thing in

its entirety it's not spying spying is

an exclusive activity and since anyone

can watch anyone this is simply how the

anterians live they have no word for

secrecy life was turbulent at first the

whispered slight to the bath house the

swindles of the marketplace suddenly

watchable for all plus crime rings and

crooked politicians could be listened in

on at the moment's notice illicit love

affairs observed by anyone sufficiently

voyeuristic but the was made recent

Generations have grown up with no

concepts of concealment and do not seem

to suffer for it everything is visible

in the water even the most mundane acts

the brushing of one's teeth the Brewing

of one's tea is performed with attention

and flare for anyone and everyone may be

watching there is nothing hidden every

eye is all seeing and all

but anteriori's transparency is not for

everyone and for those who cannot bear

such a way of life far below by the

ocean swaddled always in fog is the

Eternal City of tinagrat the place where

there are only Secrets the citizens

don't frown so much but they hardly

smile either possessions are many and

doors are unlocked since there is no

desire unfulfilled in tinagrad and there

is no thefts where there is no desire

unfulfilled for it was here long ago the

great wizard first went for shelter and

was refused and to thank the people of

tinagrass for their apathy he returned

to the conclusion of the war and

Enchanted the water here too the wet fog

that permeates every street and house

the snow that thaws come spring though

while the water in tinagrad sees all

citizens have no access to its

omniscient Visions there is only one

Watcher out of the bedrooms wear glasses

on nightstands listen of those mumbled

Untold Secrets the Tiner gradients admit

in their sleep down the cobbled stones

where the puddles watch of land disputes

and unrequited love to the harbor where

the ocean silently records of overpriced

fish and drunken Barb rules out into the

bay where there resides a great Kraken

who watches the Kraken never sleeps

never falters his mind unjudging as a

seismograph and the Kraken is very

hungry and its favorite meal is Secrets

as delivered by the water to its

unblinking eyes the secrets of tinagrat

each impulse and desire of each citizen

such that they may be met if favorable

to the market or suppressed if not such

that at the slightest hint of

eccentricity citizens may be placed

under heightened surveillance such that

none need ever fear or want and in

return for this miracle of constant

safety and satisfaction all the Kraken

requires is a little knowledge and all

it wants to know is everything give me

your tired thoughts your poor decisions

your huddled missives yearning to be

free who have you been going to bed with

who would you like to go to bed with

thinking of starting a family thinking

of cutting off your family preferred

brand of breakfast cereal least favorite

season what does home mean to you and if

the miracle should falter for a second

and a citizen-like catch sight of a

great hungry eye peering from the water

and cry out these are secrets my secrets

and my secrets are all I have the Kraken

only replies you ungrateful little

insect for what pretty things I have

sold you what peace times I have

delivered you what love I have shown you

what

is privacy for how do we resist the

increasingly aggressive attempts to

remove it from us and is this video

sponsored by an easy to use and reliable

VPN

no it is not if you don't live

alone but get the chance to sometime I

would recommend it because you can

constantly eat junk food without shame

become entirely nocturnal and discover

the true meaning of independent living

oh yeah where's your toilet regime now

mum but living alone is a pretty recent

phenomenon just sleeping alone is a

pretty recent phenomenon even for the

historically Rich privacy is an

invention we made that  up but how

do we get here well for the first few

hundred thousand years of our time on

this watery spaceship it is unlikely

there were many loners for

hunter-gatherers going it alone probably

meant death because strength in numbers

was about the only trick that caps Us

Alive we were social by necessity and we

didn't do walls yet so other than the

confines of your own mind how could you

have privacy in that social

configuration what was the most mostest

game-changing human invention fire the

transistor all pretty rad yes but the

wall is going to be up there in the top

five at least we've been doing walls for

about 23 000 years now the oldest one

we've found being in Greece of course

it's grease it's always Greece and not

only do walls signify property and

property is a pretty weird idea if

you've never heard of it before first

person to get the land gets the land

forever why but it also means that

security means castles means established

power structures and it's only so long

before Walls Start to mean privacy and

that was more or less codified for the

first time we know of by the Greeks

because it's always the Greeks isn't it

and the distinction between the polis

and the Oikos the police being public

life politics she eat it outside really

and the Oikos your house your family

life  you did inside really but even

then in most Greek tragedies the only

thing worse than getting executed was

being alone being exiled still our

ancestors understood privacy of the mind

just fine as in Secrets the Chinese

managed to keep the particulars of silk

production a secret for over a thousand

years by making you dead if you blab to

anyone then there was Greek Fire because

it's always the  Greeks isn't it

a flammable slime used by the byzantines

during battle yeah that's right a 7th

century flamethrower and the secret of

its composition was so well kept we

still don't really know what the hell it

was today also the legend goes that when

Genghis Khan dies his funeral escort

kept his burial site a secret by

murdering anyone they passed on the way

there bit heavy-handed but points for

execution

literally literally

I long to die for the next ages us

Europeans at least did pretty much

everything under the Gaze of someone

else while at home eating weeping and

sleeping it's how we built our houses it

wasn't until the 17th century that some

genius thought to invent an entire room

for the bed the bedroom if you will but

beds themselves were crazy expensive

most homes could only afford a single

bed shared by family and guests which

meant not only did you get to witness

your nearest and dearest sleeping but

all the other activities that might

occur in a bedroom and while there

wasn't really a concept of medieval

privacy either there were ways to obtain

a little alone time like pissing off the

church and getting excommunicated big

fun or cutting off heads for a living

working as an executioner was so

shameful you wouldn't be invited into

others homes couldn't enter churches and

had to live on the fringes of town if

privacy is the right to be let alone

then along with monks executioners were

arguably kind of the pioneers of

something beginning to sound like modern

privacy but it would take a while yet in

the early 1900s Abigail Roberson one day

noticed a photo of herself on a poster

advertising flower she didn't remember

endorsing any flower so she sued the

company in question for using her

likeness without her permission she won

the case however the defendants appealed

claiming they hadn't taken anything of

worth from her and and they won the

appeal the chief judge writing actually

she should be touched as the ad was

quote a compliment to her beauty aha but

a pleasant surprise the public was

pissed at the ruling maximum pissed

resulting not too long after in the

first instance of legislation forbidding

using ones likeness without their

permission the beginning of modern

privacy really ironically the chief

judge we just mentioned who ruled

against her and said she should be

stoked because she was pretty and shut

up would run for president in a few

years and after getting snapped

constantly by photographers waxed at

Great length about how it was an

invasion of his privacy Abigail Roberson

reminded him in a letter in the New York

Times but you said there is no right to

privacy not so fun when it's being done

to you a what a  and in just a few

decades Jesus Christo Things Are about

to get weirder because by now it's the

1960s computers are rather massive

trousers are rather silly and the cold

war is heating up the US Department of

Defense is interested in distributing

information across computers in case one

Link in the chain let's say breaks down

a bit enter are pronounce the first

packet switch Network and grandfather of

the modern internet and the first

message ever sent over arpanet from UCLA

to Stanford Research Institute was

supposed to be login however the system

fell over after two letters meaning the

internet's first message to the world

was low as in lo and behold I have

arrived you fox first words don't get

better than that by 1971 the first email

has been sent by 1973 the first

transatlantic connection is made then by

1978 Robert Khan and Vince Cerf have

designed TCP IP or transmission control

protocol Internet Protocol and if the

internet talks in the language this is

it by the 90s Tim berners-lee has kindly

invented the World Wide Web the retreat

evil of information architecture the

modern net is built on top of making

possible hypertext hyperlinks and the

first website you can still visit it

today and naturally comes the first

webcam it monitors a coffee machine at

Cambridge University for some reason

1980 3 the first graphical web browser

Mosaic and then the Moolah oh the Moolah

1994 and amazon.com makes his first

sales one of them notably to Bulgaria

for some books paid for in cash which is

sent over hidden inside a floppy disk so

the Customs inspectors won't steal it

clever as ever Bobby Bulgaria then enter

me and perhaps you 90s internet was

pretty weird a patchwork amalgamation of

misfiring search engines God or full

site design and if someone had the

audacity to phone your house all they

got was The Sound of the modem it was

great but stranger While most

technologists have been expecting a

robotics Revolution for the end of the

century what we got instead was a

Communications Revolution clearly

preferable since yeah the internet can't

fetch your tea but more importantly you

can't watch pornography on a robot and

really this is just one idiot's biased

Nostalgia for a simpler time but not a

few decades ago the Hope For What the

internet could do was Limitless most

societal issues surely stemmed from a

lack of information and with all human

knowledge at our fingertips we would all

eventually come to the same objective

conclusions emerge from division and

ignorance and draw together in peace as

a unified digital family

and that went so-so oh yeah Utopia must

be just over the hill now mate I can

almost see it oh no that's just my dad's

only fans account hey Dad what A Brave

New World we've built somehow Brave New

World in 1984 at the exact same time we

were promised the end of History we were

promised ultimate truth we're supposed

to be solving world hunger and building

Interstellar Starships what is chungus I

do not understand what have we done to

ourselves we've broken epistemology

itself sacrificed truth in favor of

mediated hyper reality and for what for

what what the  is chungus

sorry we were supposed to be talking

about privacy weren't we well we're kind

of boned right now and to talk about

that we'll need a patronizingly simple

history of privacy which we've sort of

just done and some kind of beat

preferably a fat one

yep that'll do hey this is the

panopticon it's a prison design a guard

Tower sits at the center so the guard

can see all the inmates in a helpful 360

Panorama The Twist is that the prisoners

can't see into the tower and so never

know when they're being watched so they

may as well assume they're always being

watched the constant implication of

surveillance and what relevance could

this have as a modern metaphor we

already know that governments are

snooping on our digital lives with

impunity but it's not just States

playing that game we're now knee-deep in

a technological Moment The Thinker

shashana zubov calls surveillance

capitalism or rather turning the

internet into a data Mill for no fun and

lots of profit and it has the potential

not just to corrupt the future of the

internet but remove any possibility of

digital privacy ever again in the early

2000s the.com Bubble Burst this was a

problem for Silicon Valley because no

one quite knew how to monetize the

internet yet and that 17th personal

yacht ain't just gonna buy itself Google

was clever they noticed the courtesy of

all the searches they were providing

they were that on a massive Buffet of

data from and about their users lots of

that data could be used to optimize

Google itself but a huge amount was left

over and incidental which we may as well

call behavioral Surplus this was simple

stuffer firsts like noticing if a user

makes a lot of typos maybe that means

they're in a hurry or if they're

particularly diligent about apostrophes

maybe they're all bookish or whatever

but in a stroke of Walter White levels

of cunning Google realized they could

use this leftover information to

generate predictive patterns about a

user's moods and desires and create

absurdly well-targeted advertising and

the great googly moogly it worked it

made them Rich beyond all imagining and

the best part is it's free users gave

them their secrets for free in searches

now at this point no one is surprised

that if in a moment of 3 30 am whiskey

induced curiosity one searches willy

bigger how you will be bombarded for the

next 15 years with adverts for

questionable tonics and small weights on

Long strings kind of weird kinda

annoying but it's so much more Sinister

than that because as Google branched out

intermedia and email and navigation the

data points for Behavioral Surplus for

its user Secrets grew and grew the inner

lives of Google's users became its

primary resource a fully automated data

Mill extracting highly specific details

of a user's psychology and turning that

into big bucks via advertising and of

course the more data you collect about

users as in the more behavioral Surplus

you extract the more behavioral

correlations you can find and the more

efficient the game gets if I know that

you're trying to sell a wedding ring and

hire a divorce lawyer then I also know

you're probably at that point in your

life when it's a 95 vodka made from deck

chairs could sound appealing just been

Amazing shoes contemplating turning your

life around would some deck chair vodka

throw Health trackers and digital

thermostats and smart cars into the mix

all of them collecting buckets of

personal data it's possible to build an

even more accurate model of your desire

helpfully recorded and transmitted by

no more than a foot away from our bodies

carnivores as shashana zuboff

puts it you take something from someone

without their knowledge claim you own it

and then use it to become

unprecedentedly wealthy or you know

theft yeah but is it really theft if it

doesn't impact us on a day-to-day level

yes

yes yes there's a fun adage that if the

product is free then you're the product

but here it's more like you're the raw

implied surveillance and even better

surveillance is now being framed as just

how things are on the internet just

another mosquito on the digital Beach

it's fine all of the time and what else

is in the teachers of peaches and

turning into an informational hostage

situation digital thermostats that will

stop updating their software if you

refuse to give the parent company your

usage data apps that conveniently forget

to mention by using them in the first

place you've tacitly agreed to pass on

your blood sugar level or details of a

menstrual cycle how the  did we get

here it isn't that different to Abigail

Roberson's situation a hundred years ago

The Flower company took her physical

likeness for profit behavioral Surplus

is the harvesting and commodification of

our digital likenesses our data our

secrets for profit and if one's response

is well if you have nothing to hide you

have nothing to fear okay sounds great

but upon uttering that I hope you'll

allow your bathroom door to be removed

and to have live streaming thermal

cameras installed in which have a room

of the house you undertake the majority

of your sexy times because nothing to

hide nothing to fear right privacy isn't

about having somewhere to do drug deals

it's a basic tenet of modern human

living it is the right to be let alone

and we've only just codified it and we

may already be about to lose it if

companies can infer that we're bereaved

or pregnant or introverted or just going

through one of the many thousands of

Life crises humans enjoy during their

time as sentient meet well

simultaneously we know basically nothing

about how these companies are collecting

and using our data that that is an

egregious asymmetry a full wave

rectified data extraction panopticon

with the sole purpose of commodifying

our psychology of commodifying our

secrets now one obvious solution to this

is the restating of one's data as one's

personal property the problem with that

is that personal property can be sold

can become a commodity and your privacy

and your data are no more a commodity

than your right to free association or

Oxygen Plus behavioral Surplus isn't

just about an individual's data it's

about the data of groups and

demographics and things that can't be

personally owned but are terribly useful

as data points but whatever the solution

if we want to steer history away from

this waterfall it's going to take lots

of getting pissed off and if we don't do

something about this constantly

harvesting more and more behavioral

Surplus to keep the great data Mill

going will just be what the internet is

because that's how the next Generations

will grow up with it because the model

is already a massive part of the digital

economy later it will be the predominant

model and later will be too late we get

to decide now whether this was just a

historical blip like the rubber Barons

of the Gilded age or the shape of things

to come effectively killing privacy

forever

the Big Brother of surveillance has a

little brother called a surveillance

rather than being surveilled from the

top down systems watch from the bottom

up dashboard cameras for example

rebalancing the symmetry of Secrets by

watching the watches and maybe the best

fictional extreme of this ever written

is a Sci-Fi novel called the lights of

other days and I'm going to spoil a few

now since clearly you have nowhere

better to be and secondly because

you sometime in the nearest Future a

company cracks wormholes only the

wormholes are too small to send anything

through too small to see even but you

can peek inside so you can open a

wormhole anywhere on the planet and spy

on anyone on the planet without them

knowing and of course one of the main

uses immediately becomes surveilling

those more powerful watching the back

rooms of governments and corporations

which makes corruption very difficult

then things get rather strange when some

genius realizes if you put a time delay

on the thing you can see back into the

past anytime anywhere you can't

influence the past because the plot says

so but you can watch anything that ever

happened things do not go well Mass

outcry suicides every terrible thing

you've ever said is now immediately

available in 4k people watch their own

conceptions it gets weird but the next

Generations to grow up are a bit more

relaxed about it all because the

Wormhole technology is everywhere they

dress functionally and for fashion

rather than modesty because why cover

anything everyone has seen already they

have no concept of personal privacy but

as a consolation they also have no

concept of being surveilled by powerful

eyes unseen because the Watchers can

always be watched they've replaced the

panopticon with many panopticons 8

billion of them everyone is a watcher

the story ends with finding out human

life was seeded by sentient insectoids

bit left field but ultimately the

wormholes become a very strange way of

rebalancing the asymmetry of Secrets by

abolishing all secrets and it isn't that

much of a stretch to imagine we might

face a similar conundrum sometime soon

the smallest camera ever made weighs a

gram and is about the size of a grain of

sand the resolution is in Grace 200 by

200 pixels but that's enough to do some

decent spying and it's not like the

resolution won't get better and it's not

like this won't soon extend to drones

perhaps the size of gnats with full

audio and video capture and it's not

like they won't be Mass manufactured and

purchasable combine that with ever

increasing data storage combine that

with whatever brain machine interfaces

the next Generations will be messing

around with it's not hard to imagine we

might build a different kind of

panopticon one in which it's taken for

granted that you're probably being

watched that everything you've ever said

and done has been recorded and can be

accessed by anyone at any time and that

you can do the same at any time to

everyone you know a participatory an

Opticon now that sounds horrible

obviously like one long episode of bling

Empire there will be no escape from

every stupid slip of the tongue 20 years

ago potentially from every invasive

thought but the benefit of course is

that unless the powerful had

invisibility cloaks or lived in faradays

ages they would have to play the game

too no one would be exempt from the

participatory panopticon it's a very

strange kind of fair but a lot more fair

than the current Mill of asymmetrical

secrets we live in at the moment I don't

know man the road to hell is paved with

good inventions when it comes to

panopticons none is better than one but

one is a lot worse than 8 billion if

technology is going to semi-break

privacy anyway maybe better that it'd be

on our own terms 500 years ago there was

no way Gutenberg could have known just

how game-changing his printing press

would be likewise there's no way we can

even guess what the internet's

great-great-grandchild will look like

500 years from now digital telepathy

disembodied human consciousness itself

who knows but as all inventions do it

will bear the Hallmarks of whatever bad

habits its parents taught it when it was

little and we are teaching it some very

very bad habits and whatever it grows up

into it will be us who shapes that who

hopefully taught it that knowledge is

power but spying from Ivory Towers is

rude which means it'll also be us who

determine the digital landscape our

descendants grow up in and whether or

not that landscape is an equitable

Meadow or a digitized Victorian Mill

whether Enchanted water flows

unobstructed through the city listening

to us yes but impartially and replying

when asked to convey not only visions of

other possible cities and other possible

worlds but showing ourselves to

ourselves whether that water runs

unobstructed through the streets

bringing edification and information

reporting of the distant hopeful and

fabulous strange whether that water

flows down to the Estuary and sustains

those towering assiduous trees of

knowledge we grow over our heads one

great Forest Network across the

revolution World talking in all

languages of all things for all time

such that if Interstellar visitors

arrived a hundred years from now and

looked down upon the world and the

enchanted water and the forest we have

built that the forest might be so wise

and mighty they'd mistake the forest for

the true Steward of the planet and in

many ways considering how difficult it

was to build and how much it gave us in

return for building it it very well

might be

or whether instead the water is damned

and the Estuary drained and wet fog is

All That Remains of it fog that Waits

with Insidious ubiquity in every spot of

the house and mind one might once have

attempted to go and be alone in whether

that fog is Engineers to no longer speak

to us of distant places or possible

Futures but only forever listens with a

single omnipresent ear to our most

private hopes and phobias whether the

operation becomes so efficient that of a

dim evening one can step outside into

the gray Twilight and look out to the

roads which one knows beneath stream all

of one's secrets to look skyward a no

one's secrets are being dispatched to

ingenious silver Birds overhead

whereupon their blown-like pollen across

the entire globe and finally received

and Consolidated into perfectly ordered

data sets in far-flong and enormous

Halls where there resides a great Kraken

a kraken who does not sleep who does not

tire and is never full a kraken who

listens of all the dreams and secrets of

all those who live in the fog and

lovingly utilizes those dreams and

secrets for the production ever more

opulent Trinkets and wears a kraken so

saturated in secrets that it considers

the currents of the human heart and mind

no less manipulable than the diverting

of a stream or tilling of a field a

kraken that knows full well if Enchanted

water only listens then that isn't an

enchantment that's a curse that is a

hex oh yeah let's hex the water

that's a great idea that total

confiscation of privacy via corporate

surveillance the usurping of human

psychology via Opera and conditioning

the great end of History purchased and

delivered at the soonest convenience

whatever you want whatever you didn't

even know you wanted the only price

being standing epistemically naked

before digital Gods Who Remain forever

shrouded and the most diabolical part of

the door that we built the cage for

ourselves not even from some orwellian

will to control not even from some

stupid fear of the other or Terror in

face of our own Natures but simply to

make a buck to make a buck

normally I would love to play you out

with some Carl Sagan ripoff rant about

how humans are great and wow Space is

really big Etc but we could screw

ourselves over so so royally with this

stuff to the point that the recovery of

human dignity becomes impossible that it

might be best not to end this one with

any false optimism

Title: Ether_Or — The story of black holes_ and how I temporarily lost my mind over an Amazon review - YouTube - English.txt
an article from an 1863 edition of

Scientific American reads experts doubt

the sun is actually burning coal now

historically speaking this is [ __ ]

hilarious but the weirdest word there by

far is doubt as in presumably some

scientists were taking it seriously then

what the hell was going on well it isn't

that ridiculous this is astronomy about

150 years ago and if you haven't

discovered nuclear fusion yet and you're

trying to work out what makes the sun go

well the sun has been burning for ages

and what burns for ages on Earth coal

does why not space coal it was kind of

reasonable at the time clever clever

very clever but wrong anyway I filed

that away in my 19th century megaloles

folder until recently I was sitting in

the 21st century coursing into my fifth

vodka and battery acid reading some

reviews of a book I was thinking about

buying and stumbled on a review that

read I do not believe in Einstein's

relativity Nicholson and Morley in 1887

showed that there is ether and that the

Earth is the immovable center of the

universe but they just couldn't bring

them themselves to believe it so a new

ad hoc lying theory was invented by

Einstein there's also a good bit with

the dude solves quantum mechanics it was

quite a ride but I became fascinated by

this review partly because I'm a

homebody with substance issues but

partly because what this reviewer was

saying in effect was that 130 years ago

scientists actually discovered ether the

exact opposite of what mikasana Malia

remembered for we'll get to it in a

moment and the Einstein messed up and

physics has been wrong ever since but

there's something weird going on there

because clearly whoever wrote this knows

about the experiments they've mentioned

they've read into all of it they just

have an alternate cosmology and I

thought oh this is clever wrong again

isn't it like the sun burning coal thing

because to be fair maybe we did screw up

somewhere scientific paradigms have been

flawed or incomplete plenty of times

before many used to think that illness

was caused by an imbalance of humors in

the body or that the Earth is hollow on

the inside or a brief but robust debate

in the 17th century over whether the

rings of Saturn were in fact Jesus

Christ's ascended foreskin

ah yes academics love them all the

dental cavities are caused by teeny

weeny worms or that Vision came from

Rays emitted from the eyes or that Mars

had canals like we didn't even know

there were billions of other galaxies

beyond the Milky Way our galaxy until

about a hundred years ago considering

how deluded we've been before who are we

to be so rigid in our models how can we

know the difference between a

revolutionary idea that hasn't yet been

accepted and just being deluded was

Einstein full of [ __ ]

[Music]

well

in the 1800s scientists were quite

confused about how lights can travel in

space because sound waves propagate

through air through water Etc they need

a medium but what medium can light from

the sun be traveling through to reach us

if space is a vacuum well one Theory at

the time to explain this was

luminiferous ether a hypothetical medium

out there in space that carries light

but how do you test the ether if you

can't see it well two scientists called

Mickelson and Morley had a neat idea so

you get some light and a clever mirror

that splits light into and to more

mirrors and a detector and the light

beam is gonna

from here and the clever mirror is gonna

split the light in two and the two new

beams are gonna boing on the mirrors and

travel back to meet up again here at the

detector together and if this ether

stuff exists then because the Earth is

moving through ether in One Direction

one beam should travel slightly slower

because it's being slowed relative to

the direction of travel through the

ether itself and when you check the

beams at the detector you would expect a

weird interference pattern because of

the one delayed beam that actually well

oops ether was a clever idea but wrong

turns out light doesn't need a medium to

travel in there's a long and more

interesting answer here about how sound

is a mechanical wave whereas

electromagnetic waves don't need to

piggyback on other matter but

essentially ether ain't a thing except

the kind my great granddaddy used the

half yeah and not only did the Mickelson

and Morley experiment kill the concept

of ether but more excitingly it implied

that light travels at a constant speed

in a vacuum regardless of the observer's

frame of reference Albert Einstein is

only a wee Nipper at the time but in 20

years or so he's going to realize that

significant and turn it into a whole

nother Piper crack called special

relativity and he does that essentially

with just postulates one no matter what

speeds two observers are traveling at

the laws of physics will behave

identically for both of them and two

ignoring acceleration it doesn't matter

how fast you're going the speed of light

will remain constant it doesn't change

relative to your speed unlike sound

waves or fired bullets and as a result

of that we get time dilation time travel

essentially length contraction objects

at relatively high speeds will appear

contracted for watching observers

suddenly we know that mass and energy

are expressions are the same thing but

most importantly the usual

three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate

system gets an upgrade when asking where

you are we need to know when to space

time the water we swim in and it wasn't

Einstein's idea it was minkowski one of

Einstein's former teachers Einstein

wasn't even convinced SpaceTime was a

useful concept to begin with doesn't

matter but what naturally comes next 10

years later is general relativity

conceptualizing gravity as the curvature

of space-time which doesn't look like

this not really as it's often put Mata

tells space how to curve and curved

space tells matter how to move all of

this brought To Us by the death of one

clever wrong idea ether in favor of a

clever right idea space-time and

Einstein made endless blunders on the

way there himself he assumed the

universe wasn't expanding which it is he

was pretty convinced gravitational waves

couldn't exist which they do he was the

king of Claver wrong as bertol Brett

wrote if some discoveries follow our

predictions we will look on them with

particular distrust and only when we

have failed when beaten and without hope

we are reduced to licking our wounds

then with iron in our souls we will

begin to ask ourselves if we might not

be right after all

why are we talking about this oh yeah

because light just carried on getting

weirder and Einstein was wrong about a

bunch more [ __ ] so for centuries before

no one was quite sure what light is

Newton thought light might be made of

particles because it can be refracted in

a prism and maybe the different colors

are different types of particles then

again if you shine two beams of light

across each other just like the mecco

cinemally experiment if light is made of

particles you think there'd be

collisions which there aren't suggesting

light is a wave so which is it well

Along Comes This absolute unit again and

explains something called the

photoelectric effect which is where so

you've got a metal plate and there's

atoms in it and stuff and if you shine a

beam of light onto the plate electrons

in the plate are gonna boing and you can

detect them as they're ejected now if

we're of the opinion that light is a

wave you'd think you could just keep

blasting the electrons with light and

increasing the intensity and eventually

you pass a certain threshold and the

electrons would dislodge but actually as

it happens electrons only dislodge if

the light passes above a certain

frequency regardless of intensity or

duration of exposure

um why well it turns out that's because

light is quantized as in it travels as

little discrete things photons not waves

so light is definitely made of particles

but it's also not because sometimes it

produces interference patterns as we've

discussed already so is light a particle

or a wave and the physics Community

replied yes and so began quantum physics

we're going to need completely new

mathematics to describe the wave

particle duality of matter and what

comes next are some pretty famous

disagreements between Niels Bohr another

great physicist and Einstein the problem

was that by then quantum physics had

become a statistical science it works in

probabilities not least of all the

uncertainty principle one of the pillars

of the quantum world and what that says

basically is the more precisely you

measure the position of a particle the

less you know about its momentum and

vice versa which points the particle was

only being available to us before

measurements as inherently probabilistic

meaning before measurement subatomic

particles can be treated as being in all

possible States in a superposition but

when we measure them we collapse the

wave function of the particle and they

become real definitive things but what

were they doing before we measured them

with this model the causality of

classical science goes out the window

and Einstein hated this surely the

universe is deterministic he thought we

can't just have Randomness floating

around there must be hidden variables we

don't know about determining what

pascals are doing prior to measurement

as he put it God does not play dice to

which ball replied Einstein stopped

telling God what to do but it's

beginning to seem today as though God

maybe does play dice Each decade Quantum

models of the subatomic just get more

and more accurate if there is some

glaring deterministic hole we ain't

found it yet quantum theory works just

as well if you assume the subatomic

world is inherently probabilistic weird

as that may feel many today think

Einstein was clinging to Old classical

ways of thinking and that we've moved

past such Paradigm but in any case as

brecht put it the aim of science is not

to open the door to infinite wisdom but

to set a limit to infinite error

why are we talking about this oh yeah

because by then because of wondering

about ether because of clever wrong

disagreements about what light and

matter are we have the two most powerful

models of reality humans have ever

possessed quantum mechanics the science

of the very small and general relativity

explaining the interplay of matter and

curved space and for all the good

they've done for cosmology and

Technology they came together to make a

monster about a month after Einstein

puts out his paper on general relativity

he receives a letter it's sent by one

Carl schwarzchild directly from the

Russian front of world war one and it

contains a solution to Einstein's field

equations describing specifically how

space-time would curve around a

spherical body like a star today we call

it the Schwartz child metric but what

the solution predicts is that if say a

very large star ran out of fuel and say

collapsed in on itself due to a lack of

internal pressure it would fall into

such an extreme state of confinements it

would result in a point of Infinite

Space FaceTime curvature Einstein would

write a paper highly skeptical that

these so-called singularities could ever

really exist but in actual facts what

Schwartz child has just inadvertently

discovered are black holes and they do

in fact very much exist today we know

even more to be freaked out about for

starters black holes are not rare the

nearest to us is a mere 1500 light years

away Gaia bh1 and there are possibly 100

million in our galaxy alone almost

certainly formed by dying Stars a star

just three times the massive hours is

all the mass needed to create a black

hole then of course there's the

supermassive variety which can be

upwards of billions of times the mass of

our sun there's a supermassive black

hole at the heart of our galaxy called

Sagittarius A star and probably one at

the heart of every other large Galaxy

and black hole is quite a misnomer

they're some of the brightest objects in

the universe as gas is pulled in by a

black hole it creates friction with all

the other gas already orbiting it called

an accretion disk friction so intense it

produces light bright enough to see

thousands of light years away still it's

the inside of a black hole we really

have to worry about because if you were

insane enough to go near one you would

first find yourself inside the Isco the

innermost stable circular orbits which

is exactly what it sounds like the last

toilet break before apocalypse next you

would approach The Event Horizon from

quantum mechanics we know that in the

normal Universe virtual particle

anti-particle pairs are constantly

arising from the quantum vacuum then

annihilating each other near the Event

Horizon of a black hole though

occasionally one of these particles will

enter the Event Horizon never to return

but its counterpart will manage to

escape the black hole in a process known

as Hawking radiation through this loss

of energy we can infer that black holes

are not Invincible billions of years

though it may be they do eventually

evaporate but nevertheless crossing the

Event Horizon nothing would seem

particularly strange to you at first

what's changed is that not only has it

become impossible for you to send

messages out but to escape at all with

the Escape veloc now equaling the speed

of light nothing leaves not light itself

not time and here everything begins to

break down including you shortly thanks

to Tidal forces in a process called

spaghettification that is the gravity at

your head is so much weaker than the

gravity at your feet you'll be stretched

out like enjoying a medieval torture

rack but assuming you stayed alive

somehow relativity tells us that

space-time is soon to become so

compacted it results in a point of zero

volume and infinite density The

Singularity this is why nothing escapes

because there simply is no longer an out

even geometrically possible and as the

death of dimensionality begins time

would become a spatial Dimension and

directionally each path you try to take

out would only lead you further down

towards the singularity and in this way

black holes are not objects but perfect

absence as relativity stands today they

are schisms in space-time itself

beemoths of infinite curvature

nullifying inescapable the points at

which all the gaps in our modern

theories converge as brecht wrote in the

dark times will there also be singing

yes there will also be singing

about the dark times

anyway that can't be the full picture

because we don't have a theory of

quantum gravity yet as in we don't know

how to describe gravity on a subatomic

scale ask a physicist to calculate the

gravitational field of an electron in

superposition and you'll either get a

shrug or a kick up the ass and until

quantum mechanics and gravity kiss and

make up the inside of black holes are a

mystery as is much of the universe

itself still it's been a few months

since I found that Amazon review

obviously whoever wrote it I wish them

well and hoped something they love

catches on fire but the more I think

about the thing the part that irritates

isn't the vandalization of thousands of

scientists careers it's the sadness of

missing out on a good story because last

century physics had a very Wiggly plot

and the main characters screwed up just

as much as they succeeded but it was a

darn good yarn and it's all very well to

go back through The Saga of Science and

try ripping out the Mickelson and Molly

Parts but if you do that then we don't

get general relativity likewise if you

take out the photoelectric effect then

we don't get quantum mechanics anymore

more than modern art would make sense

without the Impressionists any more than

modern rap would without all Dirty

Bastard Hey Dirty baby I got your money

what began with a question around a

century ago about how light from the Sun

reaches us ended with discovering

Furious gravity Abominations at the

heart of more or less every large Galaxy

the world turned out to work so

differently to how we expected it will

doubtless keep doing this and I don't

know about you but whenever I bump into

this sort of um reality fan fiction

about the world being a little flatter

than previously advertised or whatever

else okay if you want to call out

missteps in science that's fine but if

you're trying to start a revolution you

will need revolutionary evidence because

the idea of ether is just as weird as

the modern concept of quantum Fields the

fields pervading the entire universe

excitations of which give rise to

particles it's just that Quantum Fields

currently have evidence going for them

that's it the only difference between

clever wrong and clever right is whether

or not those hypo are confirmed by

empirical evidence whether nature gives

us a thumbs up or thumbs down and tells

us whether it's true or not which is

very different to just ripping Pages out

of the story because you want something

to be true that isn't clever wrong

that's just you know and maybe the

bigger problem is that so much of what's

turning out to look true these days

doesn't have humans at the center of it

I wonder if you've ever seen Saturn up a

telescope I did around 10 years old or

so now I can confirm that there's no

Celestial foreskin waiting up there but

still my initial reaction wasn't wow I

just lost my ship for an hour and turned

into a horrified crying mess because to

see it there not just on a classroom

wall or in a textbook but actually there

to know it's enormous and it doesn't

give the slightest damn about me where

was I in that story not a fun moment but

children eventually get over themselves

of course else they become YouTubers and

begrudgingly I learned that I am

relatively very miniature in the grand

scheme of things as as we all do and

that was kind of nice because what no

one really tells you when you're little

when everything seems to revolve around

you is that one day soon you will stop

being Center Stage you will grow up and

meet many people who are smarter and

funnier than you are you will have to

attend birthday parties that are not

yours but in return for that loss of

centrality you will get to set your own

bedtime and drive and accumulate a

myriad of ever more damaging but

exciting addictions all the

disadvantages of stepping back from

being the main character are outweighed

by the perks of becoming an adult is it

the same with us as a species maybe

every moment of scientific integration

every step forward has told us the same

thing over and over which is that we are

so much less special than we ever

imagined and yet so much more unique

than we can even begin to understand

natural selection demoted us from

unprecedented Standalone Marvels to just

very clever primates but it also set us

inside a multi-millionaire story of how

lucky we were to get here and how

inextricably we're related to the rest

of the animal kingdom as humans as

organisms of the earth we really are all

one family astronomy demoted us from

galactic center to living in the cosmic

suburbs in a not particularly remarkable

solar system but also introduced us into

a billion other galaxies and revealed a

scale of majesty and Beauty our

ancestors couldn't possibly have even

begun to guess at told us that we are

conscious extensions of the cosmos

itself you are nothing you are

everything it's galactic gaslighting but

we could only have made those jumps we

could only have stepped into the new

paradigms we occupy today by maintaining

our humility by remembering that we are

still very young and we don't know how

much we don't know yet and as the

generations go on this might get worse

if we're to discover parallel branching

universes alongside our own or Galactic

Civilizations that don't give a damn

about us or whatever else initially we

will and try to spit it out for fear of

being littled even more but if nature

points that way then we must get our

shoes and socks on and go for a Wander

over into the next unknown Yonder and it

will be just as gorgeous and weird as

the last ones we've found so when one is

confronted with strange modifications of

the scientific story trying to reassert

humanity back into the center of

everything fine but like there's the

other way the corridor the empirical

evidence is pointing down where yes

truths are waiting that will sting our

pride but isn't a weird yes so much

better than a comforting maybe we are

going on an adventure don't you want to

come but there's only one rule which is

that you can't bring anything with you

no baggage about how special we are no

biases about how reality should work and

in this way we will inch closer to

finding out what nature is even doing

here in the first place as brecht

probably wrote I dislike you review man

I bet you drive a 2004 multiple review

man I bet you say on accident rather

than by accident I bet you put sweet

rappers back in the box there is no

fundamental truth we will encounter in

our future investigations that will be

so horrific or strange we will not be

grateful we pushed on through the Mist

in order to attain it that's what we do

that's what we've always done as human

As It Gets

[ __ ] I feel better

so glad we could share this moment

together you know now I'm gonna go drink

a whole load of whiskey sours and listen

to James Brown oh no I'm still angry

well I guess I just hold on to this

Grudge until I die what a complete waste

of my time and yours is all been I

hate you goodbye


Title: And Nothing Can Ever Ruin This - YouTube - English.txt
You meet at a party

You're both young, probably late teens

You've both screwed other people

but it was all sort of, clumsy

You find excuses to hang out and pretend to be friends

She has a tiny birthmark on her neck that you notice but don't mention

You catch yourself thinking about her a little, then a lot, then all the time

You stop sleeping,

and eating,

and whatever music you're listening to at the time

will be so tied to her,

that in 20 years,

someone will play that song again and just for a second

you'll remember exactly how you feel now

And at some point, probably involving alcohol,

you're going to take your clothes off together,

and now you're really fucked

because she's under your skin

You had no idea,

you can care about another human this much

And nothing can ever ruin this

And anyone who tells you otherwise is an idiot

You're not even 20 yet,

but you just met the love of your life; how lucky is that?

You're probably neglecting time on your term papers,

not getting much sleep but that doesn't matter

You get to know her parents well,

and she gets to know yours too

and you've tried every sexual position under the sun

And sex is kinda comforting now,

rather than something you think about doing all the time

You've got big plans

And nothing can ever ruin this

She shows you new music you probably wouldn't have even given a shit about before

but somehow you quite like it now

You tell you about your shit and she pretends to care very convincingly

You move in together because,

why not?

You stay up late

You drink

You screw

You watch her sleeping in the morning sometimes

and suddenly all that bullshit love poetry they forced in you in school,

begins to make sense

You don't believe in fate or crap like that

but you begin to understand why some people do

On one day she looks at someone else,

and smiles

or laughs

and you feel this sort of weird sting in your brain

Welcome to jealously

It's quite natural

You don't mention it because you're not completely insane

She probably feels the same way about you,

and that's nice

You both get jobs

You get stressed

You get tired

You watch a lot of TV together

You don't screw so often now but what did you expect?

You talk about getting a dog

She mentions some guy at work

who's been sending her funny emails

and you decide to murder him

but quickly remember that's illegal

You start go running in the afternoons

and you notice this girl that's usually this out around the same time

She's kinda pretty but

whatever

You spend less time together in the evening

You've forgotten what butterflies feel like

You mention this to a guy you know who's been married for years

and he tells you that's what happens

You've can't be loved out forever

This scares you a little

but it's alright because everything will be fine

And nothing can ruin this

You're in your 20's now and some of your school friends

are becoming architects or doctors and you're...

not

You wanted to be a...

whatever

but you've haven't practiced it in years

You start practicing again

or planning to build a business

or get a masters

She seems thoroughly unimpressed by the idea

She starts making baby jokes or

talking about buying a house

You don't really want the house

or a baby yet

because you're not that thing you wanted to be

And you're already 25 and 30 seems like a

very big number that's getting scarily close

The sex is kinda routine now and you wonder if it's just a chore for her

You still hang out

and it's nice

but you begin to worry that something is missing

The two of you experiment with lingerie

and going for elaborate adventures

and that's fun for a while

You go running some more and you see that girl again in the woods

There's something sort of

otherworldly about her

She stops for breaths

so you do too

You say hello

She's smart

Kinda calls you on your bullshit

And you like that

Then you carry on running,

and push her out of your mind,

but now you remember what butterflies feel like

You come home

You cook the same dish you had the night before,

and the night before that

You talk about nothing much

She mentions that guy from work wants to meet you

And you reply that guy from work can suck a thousand dicks in hell

You sit in awkward silence for a while

and then you watch some more TV

And some more TV

And you live like this for another year

And that's fine

And nothing can ever ruin this

Ever

One of you screws someone else

or snaps for no reason

or mentions that you should take a break

or starts getting distant

or stops talking about the future

or whatever it is

Whether you were the one who broke it off or not,

you're never going to wake up with her again or take her clothes off

or have anther screaming drunken argument about the European Union

or if dogs can look up or not

You go to bed

and suddenly the place smells of her in a way you've never noticed before

Music is shit

and food is shit

and everyone is shit however nice they are to you

And you know you've made a terrible mistake

Nothing can ruin this

and now everything is fucking ruined

You drink a lot of whiskey

You can't seem to sleep for more than a few hours

Someone mentions that she's been hanging out a lot with whatever his name is

You imagine them screwing briefly then go doing something else

You play a lot of video games

and discover that yes you do actually still have friends

and they've been patiently waiting for you for fucking years now

They listen to your bullshit politely because they've been through breakups too

They offer some nice little platitudes,

plenty of more fish in the sea,

etc

But you don't really believe them because they weren't really in love like you're in love

No one has been in love like you're in love

You and her send each other passive-aggressive texts

about getting your guitar back or whatever

And you meet up to swap your stuff over

It feels good to see her because you're over it now

And she has no power over you whatsoever

And you'll be moving on soon enough

You screw

and literally a minute later realize what a dumb mistake that was

You carry on screwing for a while

You begin to think about getting back together

She makes a few bullshit digs at you

or you make some at her

And suddenly you stop thinking about getting it back together

You argue

You say horrible shit,

the kind of stuff you imagine you won't say to your worst enemies

You play some more video games

You drink some more whiskey

You listen to some more Elliot Smith

Things are going well with a girl you met on the train

But you can't stomach the thought with sleeping with someone else

You briefly get into healthy eating

and having walks

and the benefits of keeping porn to a maximum of

17 one hour sessions a day

You keep practicing at that thing you love

You get pretty good at that thing you love

You remember what being human actually feels like

Someone tells you about a

sudden death in their family

and you realize you have absolutely nothing to feel sad about

Not really

Over time, people volunteer their own breakup stories

and some are far,

far worse than yours

And again,

you realize you have absolutely nothing to feel sad about

Not really

And subtly,

so subtly you don't even notice

you become yourself again

And one day out of nowhere,

that girl you met running invites you out

And you notice this little birthmark on her shoulder

but you don't mention it

And you stop sleeping,

and eating,

and whatever music you're listening to at the moment will be so tied to her,

that in 20 years,

someone will play that song again

and just for a second,

you'll remember exactly how you feel now

Music starts to sound good again

Food starts to taste good again

God what was all that about before?

Why were you being such a pussy?

Before long,

the two of you are hanging out every other day

and you can't remember the last time you've felt so alive

Is this what you were meant to be doing all along?

Or maybe you're just repeating the same dumb pattern again

but god, it feels incredible

Maybe the whole thing is just some stupid gamble but you don't care

You didn't care last time

Because right now, you're sure of it

More sure than anything ever,

and anyone who tells you otherwise is an idiot

But nothing can ever ruin this

And nothing can ever ruin this
